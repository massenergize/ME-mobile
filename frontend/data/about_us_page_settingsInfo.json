We plan holistically, regeneratively, and ethically, integrating as best we can social, economic, and cultural dimensions within and beyond our borders. This creates the deep individual, social and cultural change on a local level that is a critical part of the wider systems change that we need, leading to a more just, resilient and fulfilling society.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
