Though they require electricity to operate, heat pumps use 20 percent to 50 percent of the electricity that would be used by traditional electric heaters. A heat pump can supplement your existing heating system or completely replace it. Heat pumps make the most economic sense if your home is currently heated with oil, propane, or electric baseboards.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are two basic types of heat pumps</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Air-Source Heat Pumps (ASHPs) exchange heat with the air outside your home. Some ASHPs are efficient down to sub-zero outdoor temperatures. ASHPs for homes that already have ducting are called central heat pumps, while so-called ductless \"mini-splits\" are suited for homes that don&rsquo;t have existing ducting. All ASHPs provide energy-efficient heating and cooling for your home. ASHPs use 30 to 50 pecent as much electricity as traditional electric heaters such as electric baseboards. Download the <a href=\"https://neep.org/sites/default/files/resources/ASHP_buyingguide_5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NEEP Air-Source Heat Pump Buyers Guide</a> &nbsp;for more info.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) can provide highly efficient heating, cooling, and water heating by utilizing the nearly constant temperature underground to heat or cool your home. GSHPs are typically the most efficient type of heat pump, but installation is more complex and the initial cost is somewhat higher than ASHPs.

If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

            "deep_dive": "<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between vegetarian and vegan? </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vegetarian is a broader term for excluding animal products from your diet. A vegetarian diet will exclude meat but may include eggs and dairy (lacto-ovo vegetarian). A vegan diet strictly avoids any food that contains animal products, including dairy and eggs. Once you become familiar with meatless recipes, try adding vegan recipes into your repertoire as well. Dairy is another food category with a big environmental footprint.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are good plant-based protein sources?</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;As you increase the number of vegan meals you eat, it&rsquo;s a good idea to include recipes with plant-based protein sources. Lentils, beans, chickpeas, &nbsp;peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and edamame, and seitan (made from wheat) are all good sources of protein. Don&rsquo;t limit these ingredients to main dishes. You can get your protein in salad, soups, snacks, and even in desserts!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/03/16/1523119113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016 study</a> , business-as-usual emissions could be reduced by as much as 70% through adopting a vegan diet and 63 percent for a vegetarian diet, which includes cheese, milk, and eggs. These changes woudl save $1 trillion in annual health-care costs and lost productivity.</p>",
            "about": "<p>Eating meat and dairy products have a large impact on climate change, with livestock producing about 14.5 % of the world's greenhouse gases each year. Scientists warn that the current system of production and pattern of consumption cannot be sustained, and the adoption of a more plant-based diet must be a part of the answer (see <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Poore and Nemecek, Science</a> ). Making changes to your eating habit can be done at your own pace and with little financial investment--but have a big climate impact. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Start with less beef. </strong>&nbsp;The list below of common protein sources from the <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/meateatersguide/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters/climate-and-environmental-impacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Environmental Working Group</a> shows the climate &nbsp;impact of various foods. Taking into account production emissions and post farm emissions like processing, transport, retail, cooking, and waste disposal, it is clear that getting meat to the dinner table generates a lot more greenhouse gases per kilogram than plant-based proteins. &nbsp;Just reducing the amount of beef the average American consumes can make a big difference. Make the commitment to reducing or the foods with higher climate impact and incorporate more plant based dishes into your meals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Lamb &nbsp;39.2 kg CO2e</li>\r\n<li>Beef &nbsp;27.0</li>\r\n<li>Cheese &nbsp;13.5</li>\r\n<li>Pork &nbsp;12.1</li>\r\n<li>Farmed Salmon &nbsp;11.9</li>\r\n<li>Turkey &nbsp;10.9</li>\r\n<li>Chicken &nbsp;6.9</li>\r\n<li>Eggs &nbsp;4.8</li>\r\n<li>Peanut Butter &nbsp;2.5</li>\r\n<li>Yogurt &nbsp;2.2</li>\r\n<li>Tofu &nbsp;2.0</li>\r\n<li>Dry Beans &nbsp;2.0</li>\r\n<li>Milk (2%) &nbsp;1.9</li>\r\n<li>Lentils &nbsp;0.9</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Like any good 'diet', you should consider the commitment to eating fewer animal products a lifestyle change that you can maintain over the long run.

            "deep_dive": "<p>We strongly recommend that you consider going solar asap and cash in on the <strong>incentives:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Federal Investment Tax Credit</strong> (ITC) (recently extended, but future uncertain) 26% &nbsp;on the total cost of your PV solar energy system, for systems installed in 2020-2022, and 22% for systems installed in 2023. This tax credit expires starting in 2024 unless Congress renews it. (This applies only to those who buy their PV system outright, either with a cash purchase or solar loan). If you don't pay a lot of federal taxes, you can claim the credit over multiple years. There is no $ limit on the credit, and the cost of roof replacement or tree work related to the installation may be eligible for the tax credit as well.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>MA income tax credit</strong> of 15% coverage of the system cost, with a $1000 maximum credit amount. Also only for homeowners.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target</strong> (SMART): the State of Massachusetts pays utility customers a fixed rate per kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar energy produced for 10 years. For systems under 25 kilowatts (kW), the rate ranges from 29 to 31 cents per kWh, depending upon your location and utility. For comparison, the regular retail rate in MA is closer to 20 cents, indicating large savings from the SMART incentives. The state also provides higher incentive rates for low-income customers or those who install battery storage to pair with their solar panel system, making solar power more accessible to more customers in the state.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sales tax and property tax incentives</strong> are two additional major Massachusetts tax exemptions for solar homeowners. Both of these tax breaks are attractive ones because they ensure 100% tax exemption from both sales and property tax payments which certainly add up over time.</li>\r\n<li>Retirees or single earner families with <strong>lower incomes</strong> may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.masssolarloan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mass Solar Loan</a> incentives and see even quicker payback.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Net metering</strong>: solar homeowners receive bill credits from their utility for the energy they are overproducing and sending back to the grid.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>How does solar power work?</strong> Solar electric systems, also known as solar photovoltaics or solar PV, convert sunlight into electrical energy through an array of solar panels that connect to a building&rsquo;s electrical system or directly to the electrical grid. The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) has some good background information on this here.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I know if my home is good for solar?</strong> You can view your roof on Google Maps (click on the Earth box and enter your address) to get a sense for its orientation and potential shading from trees. South-facing roofs with little shade are best, but east and west-facing roofs work well too as long as there is little shade. Ideal roofs have long expanses of open areas but panels can be placed on smaller areas as well. Any installer you contact should be able to tell you on the phone if your roof is a good candidate. Some installers only want to work on the best roofs, but ultimately let it be up to you to decide if you want solar or not. In Wayland we have homeowners who went ahead even though their roofs would have been declined by some installers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What if my roof is old?</strong> Should I replace it before installing solar panels? 15 years is about the dividing line between installing panels on the current roof and replacing the roof and then installing panels. If you install the panels on the existing roof, the panels will protect the part of the roof on which they are installed. You can have the panels taken off and reinstalled when you decide to re-roof.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do I have to maintain my solar system?</strong> Generally the panels will sit up on the roof out of sight and out of mind, powering your home, even on cloudy days. There are no maintenance contracts to buy and New England weather will keep the panels pretty clean.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when it snows? </strong>Snow will pile up on solar panels, but the sun&rsquo;s energy soon melts the bottom layer next to the panels and the snow will come sliding down quickly. Snow guards are available to protect people and plants under the panels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What about critters? </strong>If you frequently see squirrels on your roof, you can add critter guards to prevent them from damaging your system wiring.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I get paid for the electricity my system sends to the electric grid? </strong>On the days that your system makes more electricity than you consume, your meter will run backward. This is called net-metering. If you underproduce/overconsume over the billing period. Instead, Everource or National Grid will charge you for the total amount of kWhs (kilowatt-hours) for the excess used kWhs at the full residential electricity rate. If your system has overproduced, Everource or National Grid will not pay you back at the end of the billing period, they will put those kwHs in reserve. You can use up that credit during the darker months, when you won't produce as much. If at the end of a full year you still have a credit, you can \"Schedule Z\" it to any other electricity user in your load-zone. You can ask that off taker for $$, or donate it. More info <a href=\"https://www.energysage.com/net-metering/eversource/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> .</li>\r\n<li><strong>How big should my solar system be? </strong>Since selling excess electricity isn't that straightforward (yet!), it makes sense to have a system that is properly &ldquo;sized&rdquo; just to cover your electric bill. However, you may decide to install a bigger solar system with future added electricity use in mind, like an electric car, or air-source heat pumps for heating and cooling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What is the process of going solar?</strong> Generally a solar installer will ask for a copy of your electric bill and will prepare a proposed layout and financial estimate based on that and your roof space. Some parts of your roof may get more sun than others; you can change the layout to meet your needs. Once you have approved the design and signed off on the financials, the solar installer will handle the installation, checking roof structural support, pulling permits, obtaining equipment and scheduling the work. It may be a month or two until installation. Actual installation usually takes 2 days &ndash; electrical work and roof racking on day 1 and panel installation on day 2. After building and electrical inspections, Eversource or National Grid will install a new meter and give you approval to power up your system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when the grid is down? </strong>If you're looking to keep powering your home when the grid is down, you'll have to add a backup battery system, which is an expensive option. Otherwise, if there is a power outage, your electricity generation will be disabled during the power outage.</li>\r\n</ol>",

Read their testominials under the Testimonials Tab above.&nbsp;These arrays are in effect private power plants, collectively generating renewable energy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://massenergize-prod-files.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Untitled_design-230517-202905.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /> Due to falling prices and generous incentives...</strong></p>\r\n<p>you can often install a system that will pay for itself in 5-7 years if you have a suitable site. After that it&rsquo;s all positive cash flow as the panels generate power for 25 years or more. It's like a small 401(k) on your roof! Retirees or single earner families with lower incomes may qualify for Mass Solar Loan incentives and see even quicker payback. On top of that, solar panels increase the value of your home.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Solar PV produces home-grown, safely-generated, clean electricity</strong> that contributes clean energy to the electric grid and reduces your CO2 emissions as well as nasty pollutants such as fine particulates, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and ozone.

You will only start to receive solar credits on your utility bill and a community solar bill once the project starts producing electricity. This means that after you sign up, there may be a period of months before you begin seeing credits on your bill.&nbsp; Ask the community solar company to send you updates on the project and to give you their contact information and/or a website link.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve any questions, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact them to ask for more information. &nbsp; </span></p>",
            "deep_dive": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how it works.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>1. You subscribe to a community solar project.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The community solar company develops a solar project.&nbsp; The project will be within your utility&rsquo;s service territory but not necessarily within your town.&nbsp; The developer elects to give all of the electricity generated to the utility.&nbsp; In exchange, the utility creates solar &ldquo;net metering&rdquo; credits in dollars to the community solar company equal to the value of the solar power.&nbsp; The community solar company then finds customers (like you) in supporting the project.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>You sign a contract and agree to purchase a portion of the net metering solar bill credits generated by the local solar project.&nbsp; In general, it&rsquo;s good to limit the dollar amount of the credits you commit to buy annually to less than the annual aggregate amount of your utility bills (otherwise, you might be buying more credits than you can use during the year).&nbsp; Your purchase agreement, combined with agreements by other subscribers enable the community solar company to finance and build the solar project. Note - with a community solar project here in Massachusetts, you are not buying electricity.&nbsp; The solar electricity itself flows into the utility grid as part of the overall mix.&nbsp; Instead, you are agreeing to purchase some of the net metering credits created by the utility&nbsp; representing the value of that solar power.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typical terms are 10% savings off the value of your solar bill credits (not your entire electric bill). The number of solar credits you agree to purchase will determine the amount of your savings as a percentage of your entire electric bill.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are assigned a number of &ldquo;community solar shares&rdquo; that will cover a portion of your electricity use.It may take some time (possibly months) between the time of your purchase commitment before the project goes into operation.&nbsp; Behind the scenes, the developer is finding the remaining buyers, securing permits and financing to build the solar project, building the project, and getting the utility&rsquo;s permission to operate the project.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once in operation, the community solar project produces electricity for the grid each month. Your utility buys that electricity and creates the related net metering credits. &nbsp; The community solar company tells the utility to allocate the net metering credits to you and the other customers.&nbsp; The credits will show up on your monthly utility bill.&nbsp; The amount of the credits you receive each month will vary based on the seasons, with more credits arriving during the sunny months and fewer over the less sunny months. &nbsp; which are then allocated to each participant in the community solar project. Your community solar company tracks the solar bill credits that you should receive on your utility bill each billing period.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>2. You receive a monthly bill from the community solar company.</strong><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You pay the community solar company for the solar net metering credits from the solar project that show up on your utility bill.&nbsp; </span><strong>Typically, the community solar companies will offer a 10% discount on the value of the credits, meaning you&rsquo;ll save 10% on the value of those credits received on your bill!.&nbsp; Put another way, you&rsquo;ll pay just 90 cents for every dollar of credit showing up on your utility bill. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Your monthly utility electric bill shows a credit for the net metering credits generated by your subscription to the community solar project. </strong><strong><br /><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Subscriptions can be cancelled or adjusted. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most community solar companies currently offer a month-to-month commitment with a locked-in savings percentage rate on the value of the credits. Most offer the ability to cancel or adjust the purchase commitment with one or two months&rsquo; notice.&nbsp; Utility processing can extend the sign up and cancellation times. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>FAQs</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Why do we recommend EnergySage?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; They act as a neutral public marketplace / broker for multiple community solar developers.

The developers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> our subscriptions in order to get financing to build their projects. It can also lower electric bills for subscribers. Subscribing is a great way to save money and support local solar development!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Do subscribers directly receive power from the community solar project?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. Unlike a home with its own solar panels, there&rsquo;s no way to send the power generated by community solar exclusively to a subscriber&rsquo;s home. Like all electricity, power produced by a community solar project is sent to the utility&rsquo;s grid and distributed by the utility to users the moment it&rsquo;s created.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Am I purchasing solar energy directly? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, but you are supporting development of solar projection. With a community solar project, while you will not be purchasing &ldquo;green electricity&rdquo; for your own use, purchasing net metering credits from a community solar project is still an effective and easy way to support local clean energy development and jobs right here in Massachusetts. The developers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> our subscriptions in order to get financing to build their projects and they want satisfied customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>What if I move?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you move to a new home within your utility&rsquo;s territory, you can continue your subscription. If you move outside the territory, you must cancel your subscription.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>I signed up for community solar two months ago. Why do I not see solar credits on my utility bill yet?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many community solar companies sign up subscribers prior to the solar project being finished. You will only start to receive bill credits and a community solar bill once the project is live. This means that after you sign up, there may be a period of months in which it seems like nothing is different.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>What should I look for?

Do they offer automatic deductions from your bank account?</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Why do my community solar and electric utility bills not match each month?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solar electricity production and your home&rsquo;s electricity consumption are two independent processes; both vary by the month and season. Solar electricity production is driven by the amount of sunlight and is highest during the summer, medium during the spring and fall, and low in the winter. For an average home, electricity use is highest during the summer, medium during the winter, and lowest in the spring and fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utility accounting practices generally mean credits generated in one billing period typically arrive one, or sometimes two, billing periods later on a homeowners bill.&nbsp; Thus, your total electric utility bill, the solar bill credits that appear on your electric utility bill, and your community solar bill with the charges for those solar credits will vary by month and not in a coordinated manner. Community solar companies typically will bill you only for solar credits after you&rsquo;ve received them on your bill, and/or provide a periodic reconciliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>I have an electricity supplier. How would that work with community solar?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will not be buying electricity from the community solar company; you will only &ldquo;buy&rdquo; solar credits (in the form of dollar credits on your utility bill). Your utility bill lists the name of the company generating your electricity; this supplier will continue to be your utility, unless you make a separate decision to purchase your electricity from an alternate electricity supplier. If you want to consider changing your electricity supplier, the state has developed the </span><a href=\"https://www.energyswitchma.gov/#/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Energy Switch website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help you identify companies offering supply to your community.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>I live in a Municipal Light Plant community. Can I sign up for community solar?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly but it is not likely. The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources has awarded a grant to two organizations that work with Municipal Light Plant communities to support solar in those communities. Rebates are provided for installations of 25 kW DC of less. This means that a community solar project is not highly likely in a Municipal Light Plant community due to the overall size restrictions. Contact your Municipal light Plant directly and see the </span><a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/guides/municipal-light-plant-solar-rebate-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Municipal Light Plant Solar Rebate Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for more details.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>My municipality has contracts for electricity prices for its residents (known as community choice aggregation). Can I still sign up for community solar?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you are eligible to sign up for community solar even if your electricity is provided through community choice aggregation. There is no change in the process for you to sign up for community solar. See the next question for the advantages of both.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>I already support renewable electricity through either my municipality&rsquo;s community choice aggregation or through my alternate retail electric supplier. Why would I want to enroll in community solar?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To explain a bit: you are purchasing in different markets through aggregation and community solar. With aggregation, you are purchasing your </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">supply</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of electricity - the actual kWh. With community solar, you are purchasing the solar net metering credits representing the value of the solar power purchased by the utility from the solar project.&nbsp; In both cases, you are still purchasing the delivery services from your utility company.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two reasons for someone already buying renewable electricity also to consider enrolling in community solar. First, you have the potential to save money on your solar credits. Second, you increase the percentage of renewable electricity on the New England electric grid if you enroll in community solar.&nbsp; Advise the community solar company how you currently purchase electricity, and ask them to show how you will still save money on net from being allocated solar credits on your utility electricity bill.&nbsp; </span></p>",
            "about": "<p><strong>Why do it? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A community solar subscription saves you money on your electric bill and helps to support development of solar power in Massachusetts. This is a great option for renters, condo owners or those who can&rsquo;t put solar on their roof.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>How does it work? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You sign an agreement with a community solar company to buy some of the clean energy output produced by a solar project. That output shows up as dollar credits on your monthly utility bill. In exchange for those credits, you agree to pay the solar company a monthly fee; typically that fee is 90-95% of the dollar credits on your utility bill. That 5-10% discount represents your net savings.&nbsp; Most community solar companies give you the ability to cancel or adjust your purchase commitment with one or two months&rsquo; notice.&nbsp; Utility processing times will likely add time to the sign-up and cancellation process.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Where are the projects?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project can be anywhere in your utility&rsquo;s service territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the Steps to Take tab above to find&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">next steps</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a community solar coach who can help.</span></li>\r\n</ol>",

However, they need no exhaust connection to a chimney. They need space around them and should not be located in a small enclosed space unless ducted. They should ideally be placed in an unfinished space (like a basement) in order not to impact your heated living space, as they will lower the temperature of the surrounding space by 5 to 10 degrees F. If you locate it near your (non-heat pump) furnace, a heat pump water heater may be able to take advantage of the wasted heat generated by your furnace.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeowners who are concerned about climate change.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hot water production accounts for 13% of total residential energy use, the second highest category after space heating.

            "deep_dive": "<p>Incredibly, over 51% of the trash that goes to landfills is compostable. In the US, we throw out roughly 60 millions tons of food each year, not only wasting valuable resources (food, and organic fertilizer) but also contributing to methane, a gas with a warming potential roughly 21 times that of carbon dioxide. We&rsquo;re putting a stop to that, household by household, town by town!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why we recommend Black Earth.</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are aware that there are other haulers in our town that offer this service, and if you use these, we welcome your thoughts (email info@energizewayland.org or leave a testimonial on this site). But these are two ways in which Black Earth stands out for us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>First, unlike trash haulers, they compost the collections themselves (at their operation in Manchester-by-the-Sea) according to strict DEP rules. They have demonstrated to us their process, and have invited us to come for a tour in spring or summer. Let us know if you want to come on this field trip.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Second, they also sell this finished compost. For that reason they are more strict than anyone else in the business (that we know of) about what they take for compostable cutlery, plates, and pizza boxes, taking only BPI-certified (by the Biodegradable Products Institute). They do this to avoid plastics in their end product (more info here). This tells us that they deeply value the quality of their compost and the environment, even at the risk of losing some customers.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>",
            "about": "<p>Hate to trash food scraps but can't compost yourself? Want to reduce your household waste by up to 50%? Not have a smelly trash bin? Get quality compost? Reduce your carbon footprint? Save your septic?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons to make sure food scraps get composted and returned to soil!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can of course also compost yourself!

How can you help to stop this catastrophe? <strong>Consider eliminating your turf grass lawn.</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the EPA, off-road gasoline-powered equipment, such as lawn mowers and leaf blowers, emit approximately 242 million tons of pollutants annually, just as much as cars and homes! In the USA, over 40 million acres of turf grass lawns have replaced the native plants that lived on that land and the way in which we care for those lawns is causing major pollution.</p>\r\n<p>Individual property owners can make an important contribution to the restoration of our ecosystem by growing less lawn grass, or replacing the grass with native plants. There are several approaches to reducing the environmental damage done by lawns and lawn care practices.</p>\r\n<p>Want to see an example, right in our neighborhod? <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sh9hXJ6pVOk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch this video</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe you want to engage a more ecological landscaper to mow and clean up?

            "deep_dive": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theneighborhoodfarm.com/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Neighborhood Farm</a> &nbsp;is a small, all natural, vegetable and flower farm in Wayland, MA. &nbsp;We grow a wide range of vegetables, herbs and flowers but we specialize in heirloom tomatoes and garlic. &nbsp;We also grow hundreds and hundreds of varieties of seedlings each spring, and encourage everyone to try growing something. &nbsp;We lease land from Mainstone Farm on Old Connecticut Path, and have an on site, year round Farm Stand. &nbsp;We also attend local farmers markets including Needham, Roslindale and Jamaica Plain. Due to COVID, the Farm Stand is closed, but we are taking online orders for self serve pick up at the Farm. &nbsp;We have a <a href=\"https://app.barn2door.com/e/3DqVQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new online store</a>.

All of the vegetables, flowers, herbs, and berries are grown using organic methods. Stearns Farm is one of the rare CSAs that allows sharers to participate in the fieldwork, giving them a hands-on opportunity to learn about raising the food they eat. Stearns offers several share options to fit all kinds of lifestyles and schedules.&nbsp;{<a href=\"https://stearnsfarmcsa.org/2020/03/30/how-stearns-farm-is-adapting-to-the-current-situation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check with them</a> to see how COVID is affecting this offering}.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thefoodproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Food Project&rsquo;s</a> mission is to create a thoughtful and productive community of youth and adults from diverse backgrounds who work together to build a sustainable food system. They provide locally grown, freshly picked produce for purchase through a 20-week CSA share program. The deadline for summer CSA sign up is June 5, 2020. Produce can be picked up 94 Concord Road, Lincoln, MA 01773 on Tuesdays or Thursdays.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Why EnergizeWayland recommends these farms? We've heard good things about them, that simple. If you have a farmshare from them, or from another farm, a Testimonial here, or <a href=\"mailto:info@energizewayland.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email us</a>. Energi zeWayland does not receive money from any of these farms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Local food has fewer\"<strong>food miles</strong>\" on it, which means fewer miles sitting in a refrigerated, polluting, gas-guzzling truck to get to your table. According to this source, in the US , conventionally distributed food is often said to travel 1,500 miles from farm to plate, which is responsible for 5 to 17 times more CO2 than local and regionally produced food.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But transportation accounts for only 11 percent of food&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of total food emissions happens during its production phase, accounting for a whopping 83 percent of total household emissions worldwide (the majority is non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions such as nitrous oxide and methane emissions).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can address the production part of the &ldquo;foodprint&rdquo; as well by buying local at the market, because local farms are small farms and mall farms more readily adopt climate friendly practices that curtail these emissions. They often use fewer pesticides, rebuild crop and insect diversity, enrich the soil with cover crops, create border areas for wildlife, and produce tastier and more nutritious food. Many small farmers are even working on sequestering carbon!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Local, and hence decentralized production also reduces food safety risks, as long-distance food can potentially be contaminated at many points on its journey to our plates.</p>",
            "about": "<p><strong>Why? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining a CSA, which stands for Community Supported Agriculture, or buying food at a local farmstand are a wonderful ways to eat both seasonally and locally while making the commitment to supporting a local farm. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Local </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also means you will be spending your money on local people, who will, in turn, spend it locally. You also help to keep local land in production. And last but not least, you get to meet the person who actually grew and/or prepared your food. Ask them, do they use pesticides on their fields? How do they treat their animals? These farmers will gladly answer your questions.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>How does a CSA work? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying a share means that you are pledging ahead of time, before seeds are even in the ground, throwing your lot in with that of your farmer. The cost of the share provides financial resources to purchase seed, greenhouse supplies and soil amendments at a time when most storage crops have long been sold and consumed. The moral support that a CSA provides is equally as significant because the farmer knows that members of the community value the coming harvest and have faith that the seeds will grow!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>We recommend three beautiful local farms</strong>, Wayland's own The Neighborhood Farm, Framingham's Stearns Farm, and The Food Project in Lincoln. &nbsp;Get more details under the Deeper Dive tab. For more local farms, visit this <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/service-details/community-supported-agriculture-csa-farms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list</a>&nbsp;of options across Massachusetts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Farmers Market. </strong>Did you know that Wayland has a fantastic Farmers&rsquo; Market? Both the Summer and the Winter Farmers&rsquo; Markets are one-stop-shopping with vegetables (of course), fish, meat, mushrooms, cheese, breads, jams and jellies and pickles, pasta, desserts and ice cream and fresh-squeezed lemonade! It's like a supermarket but a ton more fun.

They have been great to work with, and their installations have been top-notch. They have installed over twenty systems in Wayland to raving reviews.

            "about": "<p><strong>How it works.</strong> A solar hot water system captures heat from sunlight and circulates the thermal energy to your water tank. Solar hot water systems reduce the use of fossil fuels. They do not fully replace conventional water heaters, but can provide up to 80% of a building\u2019s total hot water needs. See how it works <a href=\"https://www.masscec.com/learn-about-solar-hot-water\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>These systems are passive and therefore practically <strong>maintenance and hassle-free</strong> and keep on working for decades.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Incentives. </strong>Solar tax credits, Alternative Energy Certificates and generous rebates are available, with higher incentives for low- and moderate-income customers. Incentives typically cover 60-80% of the system cost.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>We have partnered with</strong> <a href=\"http://neshw.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">New England Solar Hot Water</a> (NESHW). Their \u201cNew England Drain Back\u201d system consists of the solar collectors on the roof, the storage tank inside your home, pump and controls, and an insulated line set that runs between the solar collectors and the storage tank. Installation usually takes a day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Energize Wayland receives no money from New England Solar Hot Water. A customer already? Used another installer?

            "deep_dive": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are important reasons for choosing electric cooking over cooking with gas; the climate, environmental, and health benefits are amplified when your <a href=\"https://www.energizewayland.org/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">electricity is renewably sourced</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. What are the concerns with using fossil (\"natural\") gas?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil gas does burn relatively cleanly. However, despite best intentions and technologies, fossil gas leaks are rampant, from the origin at fracking well sites, throughout pipelines and compressor stations, and from the infrastructure under our streets</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;and in our homes. These leaks release methane, unburned, into the atmosphere where it has enormous climate impact. Fossil gas is largely methane (95%) and methane is a <em>super</em> potent greenhouse gas &mdash; with </span><strong>86 times the warming impact of carbon dioxide </strong>(over the first 20 years, which is the period that matters for mitigating climate impacts). L<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eaking fossil gas is neither clean, nor safe, nor efficient.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To complicate the dangers of fossil gas even more, the gas we use in our homes today is not our \"grandparents' gas.\" All the fossil gas now being supplied to our region has been fracked, or mixed with fracked gas, and contains chemicals that linger from the fracking process. Many of the chemicals used in fracking fluid, including methanol, ethylene glycol, and propargyl alcohol, are considered hazardous to human health. However, the potential human health impacts of a majority of chemicals used in fracking formulas are <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2016/01/06/toxins-found-fracking-fluids-and-wastewater-study-shows\">also unknown</a>. Although there are rules requiring disclosure of chemicals used in fracking, those rules often contain exclusions for &ldquo;confidential business information (CBI).&rdquo; <a href=\"https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/hfstudy/recordisplay.cfm?deid=332990\">EPA</a> (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) reviewed more than 39,000 chemical disclosure forms submitted to FracFocus from January 1, 2011, to February 28, 2013; it found that more than 70% of the forms listed at least one chemical as CBI and that 11% of all chemicals were claimed as such.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. What are the health effects of cooking with gas?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In May of 2020, a report titled </span><a href=\"https://www.mothersoutfront.org/news/gas-stoves-health-and-air-quality-impacts-and-solutions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health Effects from Gas Stove Pollution</span></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Brady Anne Seals and Andee Krasner, was released by</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Rocky Mountain Institute, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Mothers Out Front, and Sierra Club. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mothers Out Front </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summarized the report as follows:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Over 40 years of evidence indicates that gas stoves, common in kitchens across the United States, can lead to unhealthy levels of indoor air pollution. This report synthesizes expert findings into eight key points:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Indoor air is largely unregulated and is often more polluted than outdoor air.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Gas stoves can be a large source of toxic pollutants indoors.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Indoor pollution from gas stoves can reach levels that would be illegal outdoors.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are well-documented risks to respiratory health from gas stove pollution.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Children are particularly at risk of respiratory illnesses associated with gas stove pollution.*&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Lower-income households may be at higher risk of gas stove pollution exposure.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ventilation is critical but is not the sole strategy to prevent exposure.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electric cooking is a cleaner household cooking option. <br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span>&ldquo;The study concluded that replacing gas stoves with electric stoves produces the greatest decrease in indoor NO2 concentrations. The results show that the simple intervention of replacing a stove may not only dramatically reduce indoor NO2 levels in the kitchen but also throughout the home. Unlike relying on exhaust hoods or other pollution control options that depend on people using them, replacing a gas stove with an electric (including induction) stove can decrease pollutants at the source.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">* </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Children exposed to gas cooking have an increased odds of current asthma &hellip; and lifetime asthma, according to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/42/6/1724/737113\">2013 study</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use a gas stove, it is important to provide and use adequate ventilation.

What is induction stovetop cooking and why do I need to know about it?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nduction stovetops can cook faster, more safely, and with more-accurate control and easier cleanup &mdash; all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving indoor air quality. Let&rsquo;s focus on how amazing induction is:</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Induction is powered by electricity and electricity can be <a href=\"https://www.energizewayland.org/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renewably sourced</a>.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Induction cooktops are extremely energy efficient, fast, and precise because induction technology transfers energy directly into magnetic cookware.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Induction has become the preferred choice of many chefs and restaurants, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as shown in the post &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://eurokera.com/blog/professional-chefs-love-induction-cooking-and-you-should-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional Chefs Love Induction Cooking and You Should Too!</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike gas, electric coil, or glass top radiant electric cooktops, induction cooktops heat the pot through the energy between the metal pot and magnets beneath the smooth glass top &mdash; yet the smooth cooktop surface itself remains relatively cool. And unlike other cooking methods, it does not use flames or red-hot elements to cook. There is no loss of energy through radiating heat from the surface. Kitchens are cooler. Induction is safe for use around children, elders, and those who may forget to turn the stove off. </span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although induction technology has been around for 70 years or so, and has long been popular in Europe and Asia, it's been slow to catch on with U.S. consumers &mdash; until recently. First introduced at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1933, induction cooking now comprises 8% of the market share for cooktops and ranges, and that proportion is growing.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. What other options are available to electrify the kitchen? </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electric appliances can be used for many cooking processes; examples of such appliances include pressure cookers, crock pots, rice cookers, electric kettles, air fryers, and counter-top oven appliances. Of course, these are available on the web or from bigbox stores, but consider going local and thrifty. Some of these items are commonly found at consignment stores, Goodwill, Savers, or the Habitat for Humanity ReStore. You can post your search (as an ISO/in search of) on local Facebook freebie pages, Freecycle networks, or Craigslist! For new items, consider shopping with local, independent retailers.</span></p>",

If you currently use gas in the kitchen, you can electrify your cooking with new induction cooktops, ranges, and other electric appliances &mdash; and then you can zero out emissions and air pollution by <a href=\"https://www.energizewayland.org/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">greening your </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.energizewayland.org/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">electricity supply</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Induction stoves can cook faster, more safely, and with more accurate control and easier cleanup &mdash; all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving indoor air quality. </span><strong>Portable induction cooktops</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are sleekly designed, reasonably priced, easy to clean, and safe to use; they do not, involve an open flame, nor is the \"burner\" surface hot unless a pan is on it. On almost all counts, </span><strong>induction</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is </span><strong>faster</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, safer, cleaner, and more efficient<strong> </strong></span>than either gas<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or traditional electric. By making the cooking vessel the heat source, </span><strong>induction cooktops</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use roughly 10% less energy than electric </span><strong>burners</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and up to half the energy of gas.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of other ways to expand electric appliance usage to reduce or eliminate your reliance on gas for cooking:</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">use induction cooking by buying an inexpensive portable induction cooktop</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">replace your gas stove with an induction, electric coil, or glass top stove/oven</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">use small electric cooking appliances, when suitable, such as a pressure cooker, crock pot, rice cooker, electric kettle, and toaster oven</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These options are described further under the Deep Dive tab, above.</span></p>",

The leaves and grass clippings also discourage animals from searching out food scraps.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Town of Wayland Transfer Station accepts food scraps and other organic waste, like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grass, leaves, flowers, brush, twigs, logs (under 18&rdquo; diameter), wood chips, and Christmas trees.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Instructional resources</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-farming-practices/composting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rodale Institute on composting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Composting at Home</span></em></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://growitbuildit.com/how-to-hot-compost-in-winter/?utm_source=sendfox&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new-video-how-to-hot-compost-in-winter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Composting in Winter: video</a></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Books</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let It Rot!

It turns food waste &mdash; which might now go into the trash or down the kitchen sink drain via the &ldquo;garbage disposal&rdquo; &mdash; into a rich, sweet-smelling soil amendment. Applied to garden beds, it enriches the soil environment for plants and for the millions of tiny decomposer organisms that live under our feet. Bonus: it reduces household trash volume significantly!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Why compost?</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong>(1)&nbsp;It reduces household waste by up to 50% (and makes the trash bin smell </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> better).

(3) Right now, more than half of the trash that ends up in landfills is compostable organic matter that generates methane.

To make matters worse, the things we buy often end up in the waste stream (landfills or incinerators), where they generate additional unwanted carbon and methane emissions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more mindful you are about your purchases &mdash; i.e., being thoughtful about needs vs. wants &mdash; and the more you reduce purchases of \"optional\" items, the less energy will be consumed on your behalf and the less waste will be generated in the end. Both lead to reductions in carbon emissions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce, reuse, and repurpose (and recycle). We can create a less consuming, more sharing economy and society. As we buy fewer new goods, and shift purchasing when possible to used, repurposed, and/or repaired items, the fewer new goods will need to be produced.

            "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Do most investments really support the fossil fuel industry? </strong>For example (writing in 2020), if you own Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Funds ($VTSAX), 8.4% of your investments are going to fossil fuel stocks. Or if you have Fidelity 500 Index Fund investments ($FXAIX) 9% of your money is invested in fossil fuel stocks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>How does sustainably focused investing work?</strong> There is growing interest in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing. An investment company that adopts this approach will offer funds that weigh more than financial gain as a selection criteria. You can select funds that include one or more of the three areas of focus and to varying degrees. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide what is important to you:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Environmental - as it states, these funds invest in companies with higher environmental focus than industry peers, such as renewable energy and sustainable materials. A fund might also invest in a mining company that&rsquo;s inherently risky from an environmental standpoint but ranks high on managing the environmental impacts of its products and services.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Social - these funds seek out companies that have a positive record dealing with social justice issues such as human rights, diversity, animal welfare, and consumer protection.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Governance - funds that focus on the issue of governance look for a company&rsquo;s record on executive compensation, employee compensation, management structure, and employee relations. An employee owned company might be an attractive addition to such a fund.</li>\r\n<li>And some investors now believe that ESG criteria have a practical purpose beyond any ethical concerns. The more critical attention paid to company practices and policies can alert fund managers to certain risk factors such as the financial fallout from BP's 2010 oil spill and Volkswagen's emissions scandal.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t sustainably focused investments underperform? </strong>&nbsp;We are increasingly hearing from financial actors, such as BlackRock and Jim Cramer, that fossil fuel investments are poor bets. &nbsp;Yet some people may hold on to a persistent belief that socially responsible funds tend to perform worse than the broader market. &nbsp;But this impression is countered by a 2015 study in the Journal of Sustainable Finance Investment which examined 2,200 pieces of research and found that 90% of the studies showed no negative correlations between higher concern for social factors including environmental impact and returns on investment. &nbsp;A large majority of the research actually showed positive returns compared to similar stocks. &nbsp;A 2016 study from the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance shows similar results, and the mutual fund research firm Morningstar filed a similar report in 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What can you do beyond buying mutual funds and stocks? Shareholder advocacy</strong> has shown to be successful in shaping the strategies of funds. Those who have a stake in public pension funds, faith-based investors, socially responsible mutual funds, and labor unions, can help pass shareholder resolutions that shape the investment strategies of those funds. For example, those invested in a city&rsquo;s pension fund can come together to pressure the city to divest from fossil fuels in their investments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I<strong>f your company 401K </strong>does not have fossil fuel free options or ESG funds, explain that you would like to see an ESG option made available. &nbsp;If your company does not have ESG options, use this<a href=\"http://www.fossilfreefunds.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> fossil free action tool kit</a> and ask your company management to define investment products that will exclude fossil fuel investments. With greater interest from employees, your company may make sustainable investing through your 401K possible for you.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

They are devices like phone chargers, computer cords, gaming consoles, DVRs, TVs, and even coffee pots that draw small amounts of power even when off, and can together add up to as much as 20-25% of your monthly electricity bill in this 'standby mode,' according to <a href=\"https://sense.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sense Energy Monitors</a>. &nbsp;Unplug these devices when not in use, or use plugin on/off switches, power strips and surge protectors. These devices keep electronics at the ready, but truly powered off.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What about appliances that need to stay plugged in?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Make sure they're <strong>ENERGY STAR</strong> products. When buying new electronic products, look for the <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/35\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ENERGY STAR</a> label, which indicates federal certification of energy efficiency. ENERGY STAR products have been designed to waste less energy in standby mode.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wondering if an appliance is still functioning efficiently?</strong> Connect it to the <a href=\"http://www.p3international.com/products/p4400.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kill A Watt</a>&reg;, and it will count consumption by the Kilowatt-hour, same as your local utility. You can calculate your electrical expenses by the day, week, month, even an entire year. These devices also check the quality of your power by monitoring voltage, line frequency, and power factor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Want to monitor all energy electricity usage in your home at all times? </strong>Invest in a <a href=\"https://sense.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sense Home Energy Monitor</a>, which monitors everything that is drawing electricity. It sends the information from your breaker panel to your smartphone, using only a set of sensors installed in the panel.
