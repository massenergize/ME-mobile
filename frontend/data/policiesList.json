MassEnergize&rsquo;s address for Notice is: MassEnergize, Inc., 221 Nashawtuc Road Concord, MA 01742. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;</span><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Demand</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo;).

All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or MassEnergize must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by MassEnergize in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, MassEnergize will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $1,000. </span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\">\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #34495e;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Fees</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, MassEnergize will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse MassEnergize for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits. </span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\">\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #34495e;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">No Class Actions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. YOU AND MASSENERGIZE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

If MassEnergize makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to MassEnergize&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to MassEnergize&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with MassEnergize will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\">\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #34495e;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Enforceability</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and MassEnergize regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word &ldquo;including&rdquo; means &ldquo;including but not limited to&rdquo;. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</span></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"color: #34495e;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Governing Law</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
