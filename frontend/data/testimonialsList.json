All the recipes I learned from my parents are meat-centric, but this winter I learned an awesome recipe from my friend who is a fantastic vegetarian cook. &bull;Coconut Milk &bull;Cauliflower &bull;Carrots &bull;Onions &bull;Garlic &bull;Ginger &bull;Lime zest and juice &bull;Brown sugar &bull;Fish sauce &bull;Thai Curry Paste Steam veggies in big covered pan for 5 min, then uncover and brown on pretty high heat for 10. Meanwhile, whisk together a can of coconut milk, about a tablespoon of fishsauce and thai red or green curry paste and however much red pepper you want When the veggies are done saut&eacute; three cloves of garlic and a tbs of shredded ginger root in the center of the pan for a minute and then pour in the sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes and taste test it. You can add paprika, curry powder or chili powder if you'd like to. Also you can add cilantro to pretty much any meal and it will taste good. Sometimes I put a scoop of greek yogurt on the side as a sort of creamy sauce and protein boost. Enjoy!</p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between vegetarian and vegan? </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vegetarian is a broader term for excluding animal products from your diet. A vegetarian diet will exclude meat but may include eggs and dairy (lacto-ovo vegetarian). A vegan diet strictly avoids any food that contains animal products, including dairy and eggs. Once you become familiar with meatless recipes, try adding vegan recipes into your repertoire as well. Dairy is another food category with a big environmental footprint.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are good plant-based protein sources?</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;As you increase the number of vegan meals you eat, it&rsquo;s a good idea to include recipes with plant-based protein sources. Lentils, beans, chickpeas, &nbsp;peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and edamame, and seitan (made from wheat) are all good sources of protein. Don&rsquo;t limit these ingredients to main dishes. You can get your protein in salad, soups, snacks, and even in desserts!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/03/16/1523119113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016 study</a> , business-as-usual emissions could be reduced by as much as 70% through adopting a vegan diet and 63 percent for a vegetarian diet, which includes cheese, milk, and eggs. These changes woudl save $1 trillion in annual health-care costs and lost productivity.</p>",
                "about": "<p>Eating meat and dairy products have a large impact on climate change, with livestock producing about 14.5 % of the world's greenhouse gases each year. Scientists warn that the current system of production and pattern of consumption cannot be sustained, and the adoption of a more plant-based diet must be a part of the answer (see <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Poore and Nemecek, Science</a> ). Making changes to your eating habit can be done at your own pace and with little financial investment--but have a big climate impact. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Start with less beef. </strong>&nbsp;The list below of common protein sources from the <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/meateatersguide/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters/climate-and-environmental-impacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Environmental Working Group</a> shows the climate &nbsp;impact of various foods. Taking into account production emissions and post farm emissions like processing, transport, retail, cooking, and waste disposal, it is clear that getting meat to the dinner table generates a lot more greenhouse gases per kilogram than plant-based proteins. &nbsp;Just reducing the amount of beef the average American consumes can make a big difference. Make the commitment to reducing or the foods with higher climate impact and incorporate more plant based dishes into your meals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Lamb &nbsp;39.2 kg CO2e</li>\r\n<li>Beef &nbsp;27.0</li>\r\n<li>Cheese &nbsp;13.5</li>\r\n<li>Pork &nbsp;12.1</li>\r\n<li>Farmed Salmon &nbsp;11.9</li>\r\n<li>Turkey &nbsp;10.9</li>\r\n<li>Chicken &nbsp;6.9</li>\r\n<li>Eggs &nbsp;4.8</li>\r\n<li>Peanut Butter &nbsp;2.5</li>\r\n<li>Yogurt &nbsp;2.2</li>\r\n<li>Tofu &nbsp;2.0</li>\r\n<li>Dry Beans &nbsp;2.0</li>\r\n<li>Milk (2%) &nbsp;1.9</li>\r\n<li>Lentils &nbsp;0.9</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Like any good 'diet', you should consider the commitment to eating fewer animal products a lifestyle change that you can maintain over the long run.

It is put down with little stakes and the grass just grows over it. It has a self charging station outside and mows regardless of the weather. No more pouring sweat and swatting bugs. No more paying for a lawn crew to make a ton of noise pollution and air pollution. You will love it and your neighbors will love it. You can sit out and not even hear it go about its work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>twice a year you pop the cover and clean it out and changes 3 little blades (on the model I have.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I wish all my neighbors would have one so we could have peace and quiet, not to mention cleaner air.

The bike and battery are still in great shape! The assist gets us up the hill in one smooth ride. For trips to a friend's house for the teenager or a softball game for the husband, it's just perfect. If it had a trailer I'd ride it to the Commnity Gardens.

The water is hot and plentiful, it has leak detection feature so that when I am traveling it will text me if there is a problem, and the new federal tax credit of up to $2000 went into effect in 2023. But really, it is knowing I took the next step to fossil fuel freedom that makes me happy!</p>\r\n<p>Bolivar heating &amp; plumbing, a Wayland based small business did a great job.

                "deep_dive": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heat pump water heaters work just like your refrigerator, only in reverse. Instead of removing heat from the appliance and expelling it into the room, they move heat from the room into the hot water tank. Many heat pump water heaters are &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; and include conventional electric resistance heating elements to provide backup heating when hot water demand is high.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>How well do they work?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an NRDC study, hybrid heat pump water heaters use less than half the electricity of conventional electric water heaters. Pure heat pump water heaters are even more efficient, using less than a third the electricity.

The savings from replacing a gas water heater with a heat pump water heater will be smaller, due to the currently low price of natural gas, but </span><a href=\"https://www.masssave.com/en/saving/residential-rebates/electric-heat-pump-water-heaters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">available incentives and rebates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can offset the added upfront cost and reduce payback time.

However, they need no exhaust connection to a chimney. They need space around them and should not be located in a small enclosed space unless ducted. They should ideally be placed in an unfinished space (like a basement) in order not to impact your heated living space, as they will lower the temperature of the surrounding space by 5 to 10 degrees F. If you locate it near your (non-heat pump) furnace, a heat pump water heater may be able to take advantage of the wasted heat generated by your furnace.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeowners who are concerned about climate change.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hot water production accounts for 13% of total residential energy use, the second highest category after space heating. Currently, over 40% of U.S. households heat their water with inefficient electric resistance water heaters, so making the switch to heat pump water heaters could make a big difference in residential carbon emissions. And it could save a lot of people money, too.

They&rsquo;re greener and more efficient than conventional hot water heaters, and they could save you money!&nbsp; Take advantage of generous state incentives and new federal tax credit.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is a heat pump hot water heater?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Heat pump water heaters work by extracting heat from the air and transferring it. Because they </span><strong>transfer</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> heat instead of </span><strong>generating</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it, they are highly efficient.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Better efficiency=savings. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heat pump water heaters are three times more efficient than conventional electric water heaters. They are also less expensive to run than oil or propane water heaters. Even if you currently heat your water with natural gas, a heat pump hot water heater would probably still save you money. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>State and Federal Incentives.&nbsp; </strong>Take advantage of a new <a href=\"https://www.rewiringamerica.org/app/ira-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal tax credit of $2,000 beginning in 2023 </a>and $750 Massachusetts </span><a href=\"https://www.masssave.com/en/saving/residential-rebates/electric-heat-pump-water-heaters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rebates </span></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Little or no greenhouse gas emissions.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A heat pump water heater can run totally fossil free if you use 100% renewable green electricty.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Extra bonus: continuous dehumidifying.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A heat pump water heater will dehumidify whatever space it is in, much as air conditioning does. This reduces the need to run a dehumidifier in your basement, saving energy and money.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Remote Monitoring.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some heat pump water heaters have wifi capability built in. You can monitor performance, change temperature, set the unit to vacation mode, or even receive a text alert on your smartphone if there is a problem with the system.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Leak Detection.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another feature available with some heat pump water heaters is automatic leak detection. If a leak is sensed, a local alarm will sound and you will be sent a text message. The best models can detect leaks not only in the water heater itself, but anywhere in the water supply to your home. Cold water input is then automatically shut off to help prevent water damage to your living space.</span></p>",

            "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We began our journey in 2018 investigating backup power options once we moved to Wayland and experienced the greatest number of power outages we have ever experienced in a city/town. As we weighed the options of a fossil fuel powered system versus an electric system, we began to increasingly consider a solar &amp; battery back-up option given that a) we wanted our young daughters to inherit the cleanest planet we can try to offer them, and b) the advances in battery technology made them a legitimate option. One might say our initial economic evaluation was a bit skewed as we considered more of a Return on Inherited Earth (ROIE) vs a pure ROI.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We initially considered Solar City and ran into severe challenges moving the discussions forward as they were going through their acquisition with Tesla. While pursuing that option, we moved to another home in Wayland and that is where we learned about the resources of Energize Wayland. We then conducted initial interviews with three new firms and decided to move forward with Boston Solar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From initial meeting with Boston Solar, to having the system converted and ready to use with Eversource was a 14-month odyssey with four different primary points of contact and two different project managers over that period. And we still are not totally finished with filing for the rebates and credits, and getting the critter guards installed after the final inspections.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some considerations:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financing &ndash; it&rsquo;s expensive, and the payoff period can be long. We were lucky enough to lock in a low interest rate early in the process before bank rates began to climb. We also evaluated paying for enough of the overall cost of the system up front so that our monthly bill would be roughly the same as our current electrical bills to not substantially impact monthly cash flow.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patience and project management &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a straightforward process. There are more resources than ever before, but once you initiate the process, it can be dizzying between the installer, availability of panels and batteries from the supplier, town permitting (need both electrical and building for design &amp; installation), and Eversource coordination. We found ourselves doing much of the initiating and nudging to keep things moving at pace.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expectation setting &ndash; it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to get off the grid entirely. Wayland is quite wooded (yay!), we use a lot of electricity for modern life, and there is only so much roof space. We estimate that we will be reducing our reliance on the grid by 30-40%. Theoretically, we may never run out of back up power in the event of a prolonged service disruption given that between the batteries, the continuous replenishment from the solar panels, and living in a bit of a degraded mode in the home, we should be in good shape for any future service disruptions.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s been operating for less than week as we write this article and we are really happy that we have an earth friendly back up system and won&rsquo;t have to listen, or smell, a gas generator. And it&rsquo;s nearly addictive and satisfying to watch the plethora of analytics on the app demonstrate how much electricity you are generating from the solar panels versus the grid, and to see a little bit of power trickling back into the grid, even in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p>We strongly recommend that you consider going solar asap and cash in on the <strong>incentives:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Federal Investment Tax Credit</strong> (ITC) (recently extended, but future uncertain) 26% &nbsp;on the total cost of your PV solar energy system, for systems installed in 2020-2022, and 22% for systems installed in 2023. This tax credit expires starting in 2024 unless Congress renews it. (This applies only to those who buy their PV system outright, either with a cash purchase or solar loan). If you don't pay a lot of federal taxes, you can claim the credit over multiple years. There is no $ limit on the credit, and the cost of roof replacement or tree work related to the installation may be eligible for the tax credit as well.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>MA income tax credit</strong> of 15% coverage of the system cost, with a $1000 maximum credit amount. Also only for homeowners.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target</strong> (SMART): the State of Massachusetts pays utility customers a fixed rate per kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar energy produced for 10 years. For systems under 25 kilowatts (kW), the rate ranges from 29 to 31 cents per kWh, depending upon your location and utility. For comparison, the regular retail rate in MA is closer to 20 cents, indicating large savings from the SMART incentives. The state also provides higher incentive rates for low-income customers or those who install battery storage to pair with their solar panel system, making solar power more accessible to more customers in the state.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sales tax and property tax incentives</strong> are two additional major Massachusetts tax exemptions for solar homeowners. Both of these tax breaks are attractive ones because they ensure 100% tax exemption from both sales and property tax payments which certainly add up over time.</li>\r\n<li>Retirees or single earner families with <strong>lower incomes</strong> may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.masssolarloan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mass Solar Loan</a> incentives and see even quicker payback.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Net metering</strong>: solar homeowners receive bill credits from their utility for the energy they are overproducing and sending back to the grid.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>How does solar power work?</strong> Solar electric systems, also known as solar photovoltaics or solar PV, convert sunlight into electrical energy through an array of solar panels that connect to a building&rsquo;s electrical system or directly to the electrical grid. The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) has some good background information on this here.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I know if my home is good for solar?</strong> You can view your roof on Google Maps (click on the Earth box and enter your address) to get a sense for its orientation and potential shading from trees. South-facing roofs with little shade are best, but east and west-facing roofs work well too as long as there is little shade. Ideal roofs have long expanses of open areas but panels can be placed on smaller areas as well. Any installer you contact should be able to tell you on the phone if your roof is a good candidate. Some installers only want to work on the best roofs, but ultimately let it be up to you to decide if you want solar or not. In Wayland we have homeowners who went ahead even though their roofs would have been declined by some installers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What if my roof is old?</strong> Should I replace it before installing solar panels? 15 years is about the dividing line between installing panels on the current roof and replacing the roof and then installing panels. If you install the panels on the existing roof, the panels will protect the part of the roof on which they are installed. You can have the panels taken off and reinstalled when you decide to re-roof.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do I have to maintain my solar system?</strong> Generally the panels will sit up on the roof out of sight and out of mind, powering your home, even on cloudy days. There are no maintenance contracts to buy and New England weather will keep the panels pretty clean.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when it snows? </strong>Snow will pile up on solar panels, but the sun&rsquo;s energy soon melts the bottom layer next to the panels and the snow will come sliding down quickly. Snow guards are available to protect people and plants under the panels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What about critters? </strong>If you frequently see squirrels on your roof, you can add critter guards to prevent them from damaging your system wiring.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I get paid for the electricity my system sends to the electric grid? </strong>On the days that your system makes more electricity than you consume, your meter will run backward. This is called net-metering. If you underproduce/overconsume over the billing period. Instead, Everource or National Grid will charge you for the total amount of kWhs (kilowatt-hours) for the excess used kWhs at the full residential electricity rate. If your system has overproduced, Everource or National Grid will not pay you back at the end of the billing period, they will put those kwHs in reserve. You can use up that credit during the darker months, when you won't produce as much. If at the end of a full year you still have a credit, you can \"Schedule Z\" it to any other electricity user in your load-zone. You can ask that off taker for $$, or donate it. More info <a href=\"https://www.energysage.com/net-metering/eversource/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> .</li>\r\n<li><strong>How big should my solar system be? </strong>Since selling excess electricity isn't that straightforward (yet!), it makes sense to have a system that is properly &ldquo;sized&rdquo; just to cover your electric bill. However, you may decide to install a bigger solar system with future added electricity use in mind, like an electric car, or air-source heat pumps for heating and cooling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What is the process of going solar?</strong> Generally a solar installer will ask for a copy of your electric bill and will prepare a proposed layout and financial estimate based on that and your roof space. Some parts of your roof may get more sun than others; you can change the layout to meet your needs. Once you have approved the design and signed off on the financials, the solar installer will handle the installation, checking roof structural support, pulling permits, obtaining equipment and scheduling the work. It may be a month or two until installation. Actual installation usually takes 2 days &ndash; electrical work and roof racking on day 1 and panel installation on day 2. After building and electrical inspections, Eversource or National Grid will install a new meter and give you approval to power up your system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when the grid is down? </strong>If you're looking to keep powering your home when the grid is down, you'll have to add a backup battery system, which is an expensive option. Otherwise, if there is a power outage, your electricity generation will be disabled during the power outage.</li>\r\n</ol>",

                "deep_dive": "<p>We strongly recommend that you consider going solar asap and cash in on the <strong>incentives:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Federal Investment Tax Credit</strong> (ITC) (recently extended, but future uncertain) 26% &nbsp;on the total cost of your PV solar energy system, for systems installed in 2020-2022, and 22% for systems installed in 2023. This tax credit expires starting in 2024 unless Congress renews it. (This applies only to those who buy their PV system outright, either with a cash purchase or solar loan). If you don't pay a lot of federal taxes, you can claim the credit over multiple years. There is no $ limit on the credit, and the cost of roof replacement or tree work related to the installation may be eligible for the tax credit as well.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>MA income tax credit</strong> of 15% coverage of the system cost, with a $1000 maximum credit amount. Also only for homeowners.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target</strong> (SMART): the State of Massachusetts pays utility customers a fixed rate per kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar energy produced for 10 years. For systems under 25 kilowatts (kW), the rate ranges from 29 to 31 cents per kWh, depending upon your location and utility. For comparison, the regular retail rate in MA is closer to 20 cents, indicating large savings from the SMART incentives. The state also provides higher incentive rates for low-income customers or those who install battery storage to pair with their solar panel system, making solar power more accessible to more customers in the state.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sales tax and property tax incentives</strong> are two additional major Massachusetts tax exemptions for solar homeowners. Both of these tax breaks are attractive ones because they ensure 100% tax exemption from both sales and property tax payments which certainly add up over time.</li>\r\n<li>Retirees or single earner families with <strong>lower incomes</strong> may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.masssolarloan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mass Solar Loan</a> incentives and see even quicker payback.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Net metering</strong>: solar homeowners receive bill credits from their utility for the energy they are overproducing and sending back to the grid.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>How does solar power work?</strong> Solar electric systems, also known as solar photovoltaics or solar PV, convert sunlight into electrical energy through an array of solar panels that connect to a building&rsquo;s electrical system or directly to the electrical grid. The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) has some good background information on this here.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I know if my home is good for solar?</strong> You can view your roof on Google Maps (click on the Earth box and enter your address) to get a sense for its orientation and potential shading from trees. South-facing roofs with little shade are best, but east and west-facing roofs work well too as long as there is little shade. Ideal roofs have long expanses of open areas but panels can be placed on smaller areas as well. Any installer you contact should be able to tell you on the phone if your roof is a good candidate. Some installers only want to work on the best roofs, but ultimately let it be up to you to decide if you want solar or not. In Wayland we have homeowners who went ahead even though their roofs would have been declined by some installers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What if my roof is old?</strong> Should I replace it before installing solar panels? 15 years is about the dividing line between installing panels on the current roof and replacing the roof and then installing panels. If you install the panels on the existing roof, the panels will protect the part of the roof on which they are installed. You can have the panels taken off and reinstalled when you decide to re-roof.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do I have to maintain my solar system?</strong> Generally the panels will sit up on the roof out of sight and out of mind, powering your home, even on cloudy days. There are no maintenance contracts to buy and New England weather will keep the panels pretty clean.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when it snows? </strong>Snow will pile up on solar panels, but the sun&rsquo;s energy soon melts the bottom layer next to the panels and the snow will come sliding down quickly. Snow guards are available to protect people and plants under the panels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What about critters? </strong>If you frequently see squirrels on your roof, you can add critter guards to prevent them from damaging your system wiring.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I get paid for the electricity my system sends to the electric grid? </strong>On the days that your system makes more electricity than you consume, your meter will run backward. This is called net-metering. If you underproduce/overconsume over the billing period. Instead, Everource or National Grid will charge you for the total amount of kWhs (kilowatt-hours) for the excess used kWhs at the full residential electricity rate. If your system has overproduced, Everource or National Grid will not pay you back at the end of the billing period, they will put those kwHs in reserve. You can use up that credit during the darker months, when you won't produce as much. If at the end of a full year you still have a credit, you can \"Schedule Z\" it to any other electricity user in your load-zone. You can ask that off taker for $$, or donate it.

However, you may decide to install a bigger solar system with future added electricity use in mind, like an electric car, or air-source heat pumps for heating and cooling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What is the process of going solar?</strong> Generally a solar installer will ask for a copy of your electric bill and will prepare a proposed layout and financial estimate based on that and your roof space. Some parts of your roof may get more sun than others; you can change the layout to meet your needs. Once you have approved the design and signed off on the financials, the solar installer will handle the installation, checking roof structural support, pulling permits, obtaining equipment and scheduling the work. It may be a month or two until installation. Actual installation usually takes 2 days &ndash; electrical work and roof racking on day 1 and panel installation on day 2. After building and electrical inspections, Eversource or National Grid will install a new meter and give you approval to power up your system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when the grid is down? </strong>If you're looking to keep powering your home when the grid is down, you'll have to add a backup battery system, which is an expensive option. Otherwise, if there is a power outage, your electricity generation will be disabled during the power outage.</li>\r\n</ol>",
                "about": "<p><strong>Over 350 homes and businesses</strong> in Wayland now have solar photovoltaic systems (PV) systems and the number grows steadily. Read their testominials under the Testimonials Tab above.&nbsp;These arrays are in effect private power plants, collectively generating renewable energy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://massenergize-prod-files.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Untitled_design-230517-202905.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /> Due to falling prices and generous incentives...</strong></p>\r\n<p>you can often install a system that will pay for itself in 5-7 years if you have a suitable site. After that it&rsquo;s all positive cash flow as the panels generate power for 25 years or more. It's like a small 401(k) on your roof! Retirees or single earner families with lower incomes may qualify for Mass Solar Loan incentives and see even quicker payback. On top of that, solar panels increase the value of your home.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Solar PV produces home-grown, safely-generated, clean electricity</strong> that contributes clean energy to the electric grid and reduces your CO2 emissions as well as nasty pollutants such as fine particulates, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and ozone. Every solar kWh means one less fossil fuel kWh. The electricity produced can be used to help charge <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">electric cars</a> and transition away from burning oil and natural gas by powering <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high-efficiency electric heat pumps</a> for home heating and cooling.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://massenergize-prod-files.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Untitled_500__100_px_7-230518-003039.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /><strong>Click on the Steps to Take tab above to find </strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>practical steps</li>\r\n<li>a team of Wayland volunteer coaches to help you get started!</li>\r\n</ol>",

                "deep_dive": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heat pump water heaters work just like your refrigerator, only in reverse. Instead of removing heat from the appliance and expelling it into the room, they move heat from the room into the hot water tank. Many heat pump water heaters are &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; and include conventional electric resistance heating elements to provide backup heating when hot water demand is high.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>How well do they work?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an NRDC study, hybrid heat pump water heaters use less than half the electricity of conventional electric water heaters. Pure heat pump water heaters are even more efficient, using less than a third the electricity.

The savings from replacing a gas water heater with a heat pump water heater will be smaller, due to the currently low price of natural gas, but </span><a href=\"https://www.masssave.com/en/saving/residential-rebates/electric-heat-pump-water-heaters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">available incentives and rebates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can offset the added upfront cost and reduce payback time.

However, they need no exhaust connection to a chimney. They need space around them and should not be located in a small enclosed space unless ducted. They should ideally be placed in an unfinished space (like a basement) in order not to impact your heated living space, as they will lower the temperature of the surrounding space by 5 to 10 degrees F. If you locate it near your (non-heat pump) furnace, a heat pump water heater may be able to take advantage of the wasted heat generated by your furnace.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeowners who are concerned about climate change.</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hot water production accounts for 13% of total residential energy use, the second highest category after space heating. Currently, over 40% of U.S. households heat their water with inefficient electric resistance water heaters, so making the switch to heat pump water heaters could make a big difference in residential carbon emissions. And it could save a lot of people money, too.

They&rsquo;re greener and more efficient than conventional hot water heaters, and they could save you money!&nbsp; Take advantage of generous state incentives and new federal tax credit.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is a heat pump hot water heater?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Heat pump water heaters work by extracting heat from the air and transferring it. Because they </span><strong>transfer</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> heat instead of </span><strong>generating</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it, they are highly efficient.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Better efficiency=savings. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heat pump water heaters are three times more efficient than conventional electric water heaters. They are also less expensive to run than oil or propane water heaters. Even if you currently heat your water with natural gas, a heat pump hot water heater would probably still save you money. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>State and Federal Incentives.&nbsp; </strong>Take advantage of a new <a href=\"https://www.rewiringamerica.org/app/ira-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal tax credit of $2,000 beginning in 2023 </a>and $750 Massachusetts </span><a href=\"https://www.masssave.com/en/saving/residential-rebates/electric-heat-pump-water-heaters\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rebates </span></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Little or no greenhouse gas emissions.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A heat pump water heater can run totally fossil free if you use 100% renewable green electricty.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Extra bonus: continuous dehumidifying.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A heat pump water heater will dehumidify whatever space it is in, much as air conditioning does. This reduces the need to run a dehumidifier in your basement, saving energy and money.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Remote Monitoring.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some heat pump water heaters have wifi capability built in. You can monitor performance, change temperature, set the unit to vacation mode, or even receive a text alert on your smartphone if there is a problem with the system.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Leak Detection.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Another feature available with some heat pump water heaters is automatic leak detection. If a leak is sensed, a local alarm will sound and you will be sent a text message. The best models can detect leaks not only in the water heater itself, but anywhere in the water supply to your home. Cold water input is then automatically shut off to help prevent water damage to your living space.</span></p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Emissions</strong>, anyone? In Massachusetts, transportation accounts for <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ghg-emissions-and-mitigation-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping 43%</a> &nbsp;of our greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles, in combination with renewable, carbon-free electricity generation, can dramatically reduce your greenhouse gas emissions because they have lower lifecycle emissions than gas-powered cars, even after accounting for extra emissions from battery manufacturing. (<a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy 100% renewable electricity</a> &nbsp;at a small premium with Green Powered.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a renewably-powered EV, the only source of emissions comes from the manufacturing process. If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

For a small premium, make the switch to 100% Renewable Electricity with <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Green Powered</a>. You can even combine that with <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/2089\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Solar</a>.

The wait was worth it as my Tesla was delivered in June 2018. The joy of owning an EV is, partly, knowing it is so important to our climate crisis but also the car is a joy to drive. I most enjoy the security of not needing to calculate if I have enough gas to get to work for that 8 am meeting (w/o stopping at the gas station) or whether I will make it home in time for that parent-teacher conference. Like my phone, when I arrive home, I plug my Tesla into my charger in the garage, and in the morning, I am fully charged and ready for the day! I have made longer trips with my car, to my sisters in NJ \u2013 I can make it all the way in warm weather w/o stopping to charge. I have made 12 hour trips to western Maryland and the Tesla navigation system determines the best route and at which Tesla Supercharger station to stop. The Tesla Superchargers are placed near restaurants, shops, and fast food so you can charge your body along with your car. Without hesitation I would recommend a Tesla!",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Emissions</strong>, anyone? In Massachusetts, transportation accounts for <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ghg-emissions-and-mitigation-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping 43%</a> &nbsp;of our greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles, in combination with renewable, carbon-free electricity generation, can dramatically reduce your greenhouse gas emissions because they have lower lifecycle emissions than gas-powered cars, even after accounting for extra emissions from battery manufacturing. (<a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy 100% renewable electricity</a> &nbsp;at a small premium with Green Powered.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a renewably-powered EV, the only source of emissions comes from the manufacturing process. If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are important reasons for choosing electric cooking over cooking with gas; the climate, environmental, and health benefits are amplified when your <a href=\"https://www.energizewayland.org/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">electricity is renewably sourced</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. What are the concerns with using fossil (\"natural\") gas?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fossil gas does burn relatively cleanly. However, despite best intentions and technologies, fossil gas leaks are rampant, from the origin at fracking well sites, throughout pipelines and compressor stations, and from the infrastructure under our streets</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;and in our homes. These leaks release methane, unburned, into the atmosphere where it has enormous climate impact. Fossil gas is largely methane (95%) and methane is a <em>super</em> potent greenhouse gas &mdash; with </span><strong>86 times the warming impact of carbon dioxide </strong>(over the first 20 years, which is the period that matters for mitigating climate impacts). L<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eaking fossil gas is neither clean, nor safe, nor efficient.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To complicate the dangers of fossil gas even more, the gas we use in our homes today is not our \"grandparents' gas.\" All the fossil gas now being supplied to our region has been fracked, or mixed with fracked gas, and contains chemicals that linger from the fracking process. Many of the chemicals used in fracking fluid, including methanol, ethylene glycol, and propargyl alcohol, are considered hazardous to human health. However, the potential human health impacts of a majority of chemicals used in fracking formulas are <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2016/01/06/toxins-found-fracking-fluids-and-wastewater-study-shows\">also unknown</a>. Although there are rules requiring disclosure of chemicals used in fracking, those rules often contain exclusions for &ldquo;confidential business information (CBI).&rdquo; <a href=\"https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/hfstudy/recordisplay.cfm?deid=332990\">EPA</a> (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) reviewed more than 39,000 chemical disclosure forms submitted to FracFocus from January 1, 2011, to February 28, 2013; it found that more than 70% of the forms listed at least one chemical as CBI and that 11% of all chemicals were claimed as such.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. What are the health effects of cooking with gas?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In May of 2020, a report titled </span><a href=\"https://www.mothersoutfront.org/news/gas-stoves-health-and-air-quality-impacts-and-solutions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health Effects from Gas Stove Pollution</span></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Brady Anne Seals and Andee Krasner, was released by</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Rocky Mountain Institute, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Mothers Out Front, and Sierra Club. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mothers Out Front </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summarized the report as follows:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Over 40 years of evidence indicates that gas stoves, common in kitchens across the United States, can lead to unhealthy levels of indoor air pollution. This report synthesizes expert findings into eight key points:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Indoor air is largely unregulated and is often more polluted than outdoor air.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Gas stoves can be a large source of toxic pollutants indoors.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Indoor pollution from gas stoves can reach levels that would be illegal outdoors.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are well-documented risks to respiratory health from gas stove pollution.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Children are particularly at risk of respiratory illnesses associated with gas stove pollution.*&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Lower-income households may be at higher risk of gas stove pollution exposure.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ventilation is critical but is not the sole strategy to prevent exposure.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electric cooking is a cleaner household cooking option. <br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span>&ldquo;The study concluded that replacing gas stoves with electric stoves produces the greatest decrease in indoor NO2 concentrations. The results show that the simple intervention of replacing a stove may not only dramatically reduce indoor NO2 levels in the kitchen but also throughout the home. Unlike relying on exhaust hoods or other pollution control options that depend on people using them, replacing a gas stove with an electric (including induction) stove can decrease pollutants at the source.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">* </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Children exposed to gas cooking have an increased odds of current asthma &hellip; and lifetime asthma, according to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/42/6/1724/737113\">2013 study</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use a gas stove, it is important to provide and use adequate ventilation.

What is induction stovetop cooking and why do I need to know about it?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nduction stovetops can cook faster, more safely, and with more-accurate control and easier cleanup &mdash; all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving indoor air quality. Let&rsquo;s focus on how amazing induction is:</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Induction is powered by electricity and electricity can be <a href=\"https://www.energizewayland.org/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renewably sourced</a>.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Induction cooktops are extremely energy efficient, fast, and precise because induction technology transfers energy directly into magnetic cookware.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Induction has become the preferred choice of many chefs and restaurants, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as shown in the post &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://eurokera.com/blog/professional-chefs-love-induction-cooking-and-you-should-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional Chefs Love Induction Cooking and You Should Too!</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike gas, electric coil, or glass top radiant electric cooktops, induction cooktops heat the pot through the energy between the metal pot and magnets beneath the smooth glass top &mdash; yet the smooth cooktop surface itself remains relatively cool. And unlike other cooking methods, it does not use flames or red-hot elements to cook. There is no loss of energy through radiating heat from the surface. Kitchens are cooler. Induction is safe for use around children, elders, and those who may forget to turn the stove off. </span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although induction technology has been around for 70 years or so, and has long been popular in Europe and Asia, it's been slow to catch on with U.S. consumers &mdash; until recently. First introduced at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1933, induction cooking now comprises 8% of the market share for cooktops and ranges, and that proportion is growing.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. What other options are available to electrify the kitchen? </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electric appliances can be used for many cooking processes; examples of such appliances include pressure cookers, crock pots, rice cookers, electric kettles, air fryers, and counter-top oven appliances. Of course, these are available on the web or from bigbox stores, but consider going local and thrifty. Some of these items are commonly found at consignment stores, Goodwill, Savers, or the Habitat for Humanity ReStore. You can post your search (as an ISO/in search of) on local Facebook freebie pages, Freecycle networks, or Craigslist! For new items, consider shopping with local, independent retailers.</span></p>",

They also pack the punch I need. I've not used other brands so I can't compare, but these do just fine.</p>\r\n<p>I suggest if you go electrical to choose a brand and stick with it: each machine comes with a battery, and between brands they're interhangeable, so one pack can be charging. By themselves the batteries cost almost as much as the equipment.</p>\r\n<p>I'll&nbsp; never go back to gas-powered.&nbsp;I've been eyeing an electric chanisaw...</p>",

We like the natural variety of green leaves and textures that is the foundation of classic layered &lsquo;English gardens&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a few years of weeding and transplanting we have encouraged the spread of oceans of groundcover that now do the work for us! They crowd out weeds, retain soil moisture so no watering is ever needed and also help trees and shrubs survive periods of heat and drought - but perhaps the most amazing part of all is Zero raking or leaf-blowing!!!</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s as though the ground cover swallows up the leaves and turns them into an annual dose of free fertilizer. Observing how efficiently leaves are &lsquo;disappeared&rsquo; by nature during winter and early spring, we no longer even clear leaves off our lawns - nature seems so eager to take care of the leaves when left to do so I wish more people would try it!</p>",

This will keep pollutants out of the air, water, and soil. The lawn will adopt the normal life cycle of grass. It will be green in rainy seasons and brown in dry, hot weather. Also, here in Wayland, those lawn chemicals flow into our drinking water wells, and not watering will take pressure off our drinking waster supply.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Add other short plants</strong> to your lawn. After adopting the practices in #1 and 2., add other plants that will look green when the turf grass is brown. Popular lawn companion plants include Clover, Self Heal, Violets.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Replace lawn area </strong>that is not needed for play space with a native plant garden.

How can you help to stop this catastrophe? <strong>Consider eliminating your turf grass lawn.</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the EPA, off-road gasoline-powered equipment, such as lawn mowers and leaf blowers, emit approximately 242 million tons of pollutants annually, just as much as cars and homes! In the USA, over 40 million acres of turf grass lawns have replaced the native plants that lived on that land and the way in which we care for those lawns is causing major pollution.</p>\r\n<p>Individual property owners can make an important contribution to the restoration of our ecosystem by growing less lawn grass, or replacing the grass with native plants. There are several approaches to reducing the environmental damage done by lawns and lawn care practices.</p>\r\n<p>Want to see an example, right in our neighborhod? <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sh9hXJ6pVOk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Watch this video</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe you want to engage a more ecological landscaper to mow and clean up? Maybe even one who doesn't use fossil fuels? Maybe you're looking for a redesign for your garden so there will be more pollinator plants, less poison ivy and other invasives?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Click on the Steps to Take tab above to find</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Practical steps</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>A Wayland volunteer coach to help you get started</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Recommendations for local business that can help</strong></li>\r\n</ol>",

It was in the years of the sluggish stock market following the crash of 2008 and part of my rationale for taking the plunge was because I figured there had to be better use for my money. At the time, they projected my breakeven point would be 6.5 years out. But between the performance of my system and the SREC checks, we actually hit breakeven at 4 years! And now, 8.5 years after inception, I have realized a 250% return on my investment! It is routinely 6-7 months a year that I effectively have a zero-dollar electric bill. My only complaint is not a function of the system itself, but that the pitch of my roof is such that, after a heavy winter snowfall, the snow doesn't slough off as quickly as some of the neighbor's systems (who followed our lead some years later and have steeper pitches). Otherwise, my performance would be even better! I don't know what the pricing schemes are these days - and how long the SREC program will last. So I can't guarantee you'll have the same investment experience we did. But even if it's not about the investment return, the satisfaction knowing that we're making a difference would make me do it all over again in a heartbeat! It's quite fun to go out on a bright sunny day and watch the electric meter go in reverse!</p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p>We strongly recommend that you consider going solar asap and cash in on the <strong>incentives:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Federal Investment Tax Credit</strong> (ITC) (recently extended, but future uncertain) 26% &nbsp;on the total cost of your PV solar energy system, for systems installed in 2020-2022, and 22% for systems installed in 2023. This tax credit expires starting in 2024 unless Congress renews it. (This applies only to those who buy their PV system outright, either with a cash purchase or solar loan). If you don't pay a lot of federal taxes, you can claim the credit over multiple years. There is no $ limit on the credit, and the cost of roof replacement or tree work related to the installation may be eligible for the tax credit as well.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>MA income tax credit</strong> of 15% coverage of the system cost, with a $1000 maximum credit amount. Also only for homeowners.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target</strong> (SMART): the State of Massachusetts pays utility customers a fixed rate per kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar energy produced for 10 years. For systems under 25 kilowatts (kW), the rate ranges from 29 to 31 cents per kWh, depending upon your location and utility. For comparison, the regular retail rate in MA is closer to 20 cents, indicating large savings from the SMART incentives. The state also provides higher incentive rates for low-income customers or those who install battery storage to pair with their solar panel system, making solar power more accessible to more customers in the state.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sales tax and property tax incentives</strong> are two additional major Massachusetts tax exemptions for solar homeowners. Both of these tax breaks are attractive ones because they ensure 100% tax exemption from both sales and property tax payments which certainly add up over time.</li>\r\n<li>Retirees or single earner families with <strong>lower incomes</strong> may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.masssolarloan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mass Solar Loan</a> incentives and see even quicker payback.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Net metering</strong>: solar homeowners receive bill credits from their utility for the energy they are overproducing and sending back to the grid.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>How does solar power work?</strong> Solar electric systems, also known as solar photovoltaics or solar PV, convert sunlight into electrical energy through an array of solar panels that connect to a building&rsquo;s electrical system or directly to the electrical grid. The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) has some good background information on this here.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I know if my home is good for solar?</strong> You can view your roof on Google Maps (click on the Earth box and enter your address) to get a sense for its orientation and potential shading from trees. South-facing roofs with little shade are best, but east and west-facing roofs work well too as long as there is little shade. Ideal roofs have long expanses of open areas but panels can be placed on smaller areas as well. Any installer you contact should be able to tell you on the phone if your roof is a good candidate. Some installers only want to work on the best roofs, but ultimately let it be up to you to decide if you want solar or not. In Wayland we have homeowners who went ahead even though their roofs would have been declined by some installers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What if my roof is old?</strong> Should I replace it before installing solar panels? 15 years is about the dividing line between installing panels on the current roof and replacing the roof and then installing panels. If you install the panels on the existing roof, the panels will protect the part of the roof on which they are installed. You can have the panels taken off and reinstalled when you decide to re-roof.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do I have to maintain my solar system?</strong> Generally the panels will sit up on the roof out of sight and out of mind, powering your home, even on cloudy days. There are no maintenance contracts to buy and New England weather will keep the panels pretty clean.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when it snows? </strong>Snow will pile up on solar panels, but the sun&rsquo;s energy soon melts the bottom layer next to the panels and the snow will come sliding down quickly. Snow guards are available to protect people and plants under the panels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What about critters? </strong>If you frequently see squirrels on your roof, you can add critter guards to prevent them from damaging your system wiring.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I get paid for the electricity my system sends to the electric grid? </strong>On the days that your system makes more electricity than you consume, your meter will run backward. This is called net-metering. If you underproduce/overconsume over the billing period. Instead, Everource or National Grid will charge you for the total amount of kWhs (kilowatt-hours) for the excess used kWhs at the full residential electricity rate. If your system has overproduced, Everource or National Grid will not pay you back at the end of the billing period, they will put those kwHs in reserve. You can use up that credit during the darker months, when you won't produce as much. If at the end of a full year you still have a credit, you can \"Schedule Z\" it to any other electricity user in your load-zone. You can ask that off taker for $$, or donate it. More info <a href=\"https://www.energysage.com/net-metering/eversource/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> .</li>\r\n<li><strong>How big should my solar system be? </strong>Since selling excess electricity isn't that straightforward (yet!), it makes sense to have a system that is properly &ldquo;sized&rdquo; just to cover your electric bill. However, you may decide to install a bigger solar system with future added electricity use in mind, like an electric car, or air-source heat pumps for heating and cooling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What is the process of going solar?</strong> Generally a solar installer will ask for a copy of your electric bill and will prepare a proposed layout and financial estimate based on that and your roof space. Some parts of your roof may get more sun than others; you can change the layout to meet your needs. Once you have approved the design and signed off on the financials, the solar installer will handle the installation, checking roof structural support, pulling permits, obtaining equipment and scheduling the work. It may be a month or two until installation. Actual installation usually takes 2 days &ndash; electrical work and roof racking on day 1 and panel installation on day 2. After building and electrical inspections, Eversource or National Grid will install a new meter and give you approval to power up your system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when the grid is down? </strong>If you're looking to keep powering your home when the grid is down, you'll have to add a backup battery system, which is an expensive option. Otherwise, if there is a power outage, your electricity generation will be disabled during the power outage.</li>\r\n</ol>",

They have learnt not to look for a tail pipe!\n\nThere are many great features in EVs and particularly in the Tesla Model 3 (pictured here).  I could wax lyrical for a long time however overall I would say it's driving experience that makes me glad to own this car.  It's as fast as you could ever want, comfortable, quiet and intelligently designed.  But the feature I think I like best is that the car just keeps getting better.  Over the air updates bring new features and updates.  It is always interesting to see what new capability the car has when the update arrives.\n\nThe fact that there is no tail pipe emission is almost incidental.  Yes, you do have to be a bit more planful on long trips but the onboard computer does a great job of figuring out your stops and the car will navigate automatically to them.  The supercharger network is extensive now and stops rarely take more than the time to get a cup of coffee, visit the toilets and stretch your legs.\n\nThe autonomous driving on highways requires an attentive driver but substantially reduces driver fatigue.  I tend to use the feature most of the time and believe one is less prone to get into accidents when using it.  The car has 360 degree vision and can avoid accidents better than a human driver.\n\nI would be happy to chat about my experience of almost three years with the car if you want to drop me an email at dap4583@gmail.com\n\nIf you decide to buy you can use my referral code and we both get some free supercharger miles.\n\nhttps://ts.la/david39357\n\n",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Emissions</strong>, anyone? In Massachusetts, transportation accounts for <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ghg-emissions-and-mitigation-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping 43%</a> &nbsp;of our greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles, in combination with renewable, carbon-free electricity generation, can dramatically reduce your greenhouse gas emissions because they have lower lifecycle emissions than gas-powered cars, even after accounting for extra emissions from battery manufacturing. (<a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy 100% renewable electricity</a> &nbsp;at a small premium with Green Powered.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a renewably-powered EV, the only source of emissions comes from the manufacturing process. If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

You will only start to receive solar credits on your utility bill and a community solar bill once the project starts producing electricity. This means that after you sign up, there may be a period of months before you begin seeing credits on your bill.&nbsp; Ask the community solar company to send you updates on the project and to give you their contact information and/or a website link.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve any questions, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact them to ask for more information. &nbsp; </span></p>",
                "deep_dive": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how it works.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>1. You subscribe to a community solar project.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The community solar company develops a solar project.&nbsp; The project will be within your utility&rsquo;s service territory but not necessarily within your town.&nbsp; The developer elects to give all of the electricity generated to the utility.&nbsp; In exchange, the utility creates solar &ldquo;net metering&rdquo; credits in dollars to the community solar company equal to the value of the solar power.&nbsp; The community solar company then finds customers (like you) in supporting the project.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>You sign a contract and agree to purchase a portion of the net metering solar bill credits generated by the local solar project.&nbsp; In general, it&rsquo;s good to limit the dollar amount of the credits you commit to buy annually to less than the annual aggregate amount of your utility bills (otherwise, you might be buying more credits than you can use during the year).&nbsp; Your purchase agreement, combined with agreements by other subscribers enable the community solar company to finance and build the solar project. Note - with a community solar project here in Massachusetts, you are not buying electricity.&nbsp; The solar electricity itself flows into the utility grid as part of the overall mix.&nbsp; Instead, you are agreeing to purchase some of the net metering credits created by the utility&nbsp; representing the value of that solar power.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typical terms are 10% savings off the value of your solar bill credits (not your entire electric bill). The number of solar credits you agree to purchase will determine the amount of your savings as a percentage of your entire electric bill.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are assigned a number of &ldquo;community solar shares&rdquo; that will cover a portion of your electricity use.It may take some time (possibly months) between the time of your purchase commitment before the project goes into operation.&nbsp; Behind the scenes, the developer is finding the remaining buyers, securing permits and financing to build the solar project, building the project, and getting the utility&rsquo;s permission to operate the project.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once in operation, the community solar project produces electricity for the grid each month. Your utility buys that electricity and creates the related net metering credits. &nbsp; The community solar company tells the utility to allocate the net metering credits to you and the other customers.&nbsp; The credits will show up on your monthly utility bill.&nbsp; The amount of the credits you receive each month will vary based on the seasons, with more credits arriving during the sunny months and fewer over the less sunny months. &nbsp; which are then allocated to each participant in the community solar project. Your community solar company tracks the solar bill credits that you should receive on your utility bill each billing period.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>2. You receive a monthly bill from the community solar company.</strong><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You pay the community solar company for the solar net metering credits from the solar project that show up on your utility bill.&nbsp; </span><strong>Typically, the community solar companies will offer a 10% discount on the value of the credits, meaning you&rsquo;ll save 10% on the value of those credits received on your bill!.&nbsp; Put another way, you&rsquo;ll pay just 90 cents for every dollar of credit showing up on your utility bill. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Your monthly utility electric bill shows a credit for the net metering credits generated by your subscription to the community solar project. </strong><strong><br /><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Subscriptions can be cancelled or adjusted. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most community solar companies currently offer a month-to-month commitment with a locked-in savings percentage rate on the value of the credits. Most offer the ability to cancel or adjust the purchase commitment with one or two months&rsquo; notice.&nbsp; Utility processing can extend the sign up and cancellation times. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>FAQs</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Why do we recommend EnergySage?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &nbsp; They act as a neutral public marketplace / broker for multiple community solar developers.

The developers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> our subscriptions in order to get financing to build their projects. It can also lower electric bills for subscribers. Subscribing is a great way to save money and support local solar development!</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Do subscribers directly receive power from the community solar project?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. Unlike a home with its own solar panels, there&rsquo;s no way to send the power generated by community solar exclusively to a subscriber&rsquo;s home. Like all electricity, power produced by a community solar project is sent to the utility&rsquo;s grid and distributed by the utility to users the moment it&rsquo;s created.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Am I purchasing solar energy directly? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, but you are supporting development of solar projection. With a community solar project, while you will not be purchasing &ldquo;green electricity&rdquo; for your own use, purchasing net metering credits from a community solar project is still an effective and easy way to support local clean energy development and jobs right here in Massachusetts. The developers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> our subscriptions in order to get financing to build their projects and they want satisfied customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>What if I move?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you move to a new home within your utility&rsquo;s territory, you can continue your subscription. If you move outside the territory, you must cancel your subscription.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>I signed up for community solar two months ago. Why do I not see solar credits on my utility bill yet?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many community solar companies sign up subscribers prior to the solar project being finished. You will only start to receive bill credits and a community solar bill once the project is live. This means that after you sign up, there may be a period of months in which it seems like nothing is different.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>What should I look for? How will I know I&rsquo;m getting a good deal?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately for consumers in Massachusetts, the community solar terms are becoming simpler over time.&nbsp; The EnergySage site offers tips for being an informed buyer.&nbsp; Here are some questions you can ask when deciding between community solar offers:</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long is the term of your contract with the community solar provider?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many credits each month do they suggest you buy?&nbsp; Ask how they calculate that amount (good to make sure you only buy credits that you can use).&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does the company charge a fee if you exit the contract early?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will they provide a written contract?&nbsp; (Be sure to read it.)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you pay for your community solar subscription? If it is per kilowatt hour, what is the rate? Can that rate increase over the time of the contract?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they require a credit check?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will the company bill you? Electronically? A paper bill? How do they accept your payments? Can you choose? Do they offer automatic deductions from your bank account?</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Why do my community solar and electric utility bills not match each month?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solar electricity production and your home&rsquo;s electricity consumption are two independent processes; both vary by the month and season. Solar electricity production is driven by the amount of sunlight and is highest during the summer, medium during the spring and fall, and low in the winter. For an average home, electricity use is highest during the summer, medium during the winter, and lowest in the spring and fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utility accounting practices generally mean credits generated in one billing period typically arrive one, or sometimes two, billing periods later on a homeowners bill.&nbsp; Thus, your total electric utility bill, the solar bill credits that appear on your electric utility bill, and your community solar bill with the charges for those solar credits will vary by month and not in a coordinated manner. Community solar companies typically will bill you only for solar credits after you&rsquo;ve received them on your bill, and/or provide a periodic reconciliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>I have an electricity supplier. How would that work with community solar?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will not be buying electricity from the community solar company; you will only &ldquo;buy&rdquo; solar credits (in the form of dollar credits on your utility bill). Your utility bill lists the name of the company generating your electricity; this supplier will continue to be your utility, unless you make a separate decision to purchase your electricity from an alternate electricity supplier. If you want to consider changing your electricity supplier, the state has developed the </span><a href=\"https://www.energyswitchma.gov/#/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Energy Switch website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help you identify companies offering supply to your community.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>I live in a Municipal Light Plant community. Can I sign up for community solar?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly but it is not likely. The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources has awarded a grant to two organizations that work with Municipal Light Plant communities to support solar in those communities. Rebates are provided for installations of 25 kW DC of less. This means that a community solar project is not highly likely in a Municipal Light Plant community due to the overall size restrictions. Contact your Municipal light Plant directly and see the </span><a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/guides/municipal-light-plant-solar-rebate-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Municipal Light Plant Solar Rebate Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for more details.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>My municipality has contracts for electricity prices for its residents (known as community choice aggregation). Can I still sign up for community solar?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you are eligible to sign up for community solar even if your electricity is provided through community choice aggregation. There is no change in the process for you to sign up for community solar. See the next question for the advantages of both.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>I already support renewable electricity through either my municipality&rsquo;s community choice aggregation or through my alternate retail electric supplier. Why would I want to enroll in community solar?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To explain a bit: you are purchasing in different markets through aggregation and community solar. With aggregation, you are purchasing your </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">supply</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of electricity - the actual kWh. With community solar, you are purchasing the solar net metering credits representing the value of the solar power purchased by the utility from the solar project.&nbsp; In both cases, you are still purchasing the delivery services from your utility company.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two reasons for someone already buying renewable electricity also to consider enrolling in community solar. First, you have the potential to save money on your solar credits. Second, you increase the percentage of renewable electricity on the New England electric grid if you enroll in community solar.&nbsp; Advise the community solar company how you currently purchase electricity, and ask them to show how you will still save money on net from being allocated solar credits on your utility electricity bill.&nbsp; </span></p>",
                "about": "<p><strong>Why do it? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A community solar subscription saves you money on your electric bill and helps to support development of solar power in Massachusetts. This is a great option for renters, condo owners or those who can&rsquo;t put solar on their roof.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>How does it work? </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You sign an agreement with a community solar company to buy some of the clean energy output produced by a solar project. That output shows up as dollar credits on your monthly utility bill. In exchange for those credits, you agree to pay the solar company a monthly fee; typically that fee is 90-95% of the dollar credits on your utility bill. That 5-10% discount represents your net savings.&nbsp; Most community solar companies give you the ability to cancel or adjust your purchase commitment with one or two months&rsquo; notice.&nbsp; Utility processing times will likely add time to the sign-up and cancellation process.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Where are the projects?&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project can be anywhere in your utility&rsquo;s service territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the Steps to Take tab above to find&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">next steps</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a community solar coach who can help.</span></li>\r\n</ol>",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Emissions</strong>, anyone? In Massachusetts, transportation accounts for <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ghg-emissions-and-mitigation-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping 43%</a> &nbsp;of our greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles, in combination with renewable, carbon-free electricity generation, can dramatically reduce your greenhouse gas emissions because they have lower lifecycle emissions than gas-powered cars, even after accounting for extra emissions from battery manufacturing. (<a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy 100% renewable electricity</a> &nbsp;at a small premium with Green Powered.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a renewably-powered EV, the only source of emissions comes from the manufacturing process. If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

For a small premium, make the switch to 100% Renewable Electricity with <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Green Powered</a>. You can even combine that with <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/2089\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Solar</a>.

                "deep_dive": "<p>Incredibly, over 51% of the trash that goes to landfills is compostable. In the US, we throw out roughly 60 millions tons of food each year, not only wasting valuable resources (food, and organic fertilizer) but also contributing to methane, a gas with a warming potential roughly 21 times that of carbon dioxide. We&rsquo;re putting a stop to that, household by household, town by town!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why we recommend Black Earth.</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are aware that there are other haulers in our town that offer this service, and if you use these, we welcome your thoughts (email info@energizewayland.org or leave a testimonial on this site). But these are two ways in which Black Earth stands out for us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>First, unlike trash haulers, they compost the collections themselves (at their operation in Manchester-by-the-Sea) according to strict DEP rules. They have demonstrated to us their process, and have invited us to come for a tour in spring or summer. Let us know if you want to come on this field trip.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Second, they also sell this finished compost. For that reason they are more strict than anyone else in the business (that we know of) about what they take for compostable cutlery, plates, and pizza boxes, taking only BPI-certified (by the Biodegradable Products Institute). They do this to avoid plastics in their end product (more info here). This tells us that they deeply value the quality of their compost and the environment, even at the risk of losing some customers.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>",

Save your septic?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons to make sure food scraps get composted and returned to soil!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can of course also compost yourself!

So when our dryer broke, we looked into heat pump dryers. They work with the same technology that heat pump home-heaters and minisplits work: they recover heat. In this case, the dryer heats up and captures then reuses the heat from the steam, recycling it over and over.  Makes total sense to me! We bought a Miele. There aren't many of these on the market yet, and the models are small  compared to the average American dryer (for efficiency). They also don't come cheap. But they work well, are super efficient (and plug into an average 120 volt  circuit), and you can even capture the water part of the steam into a container - so no need for drainage. Our Miele will last us a long time and we'll recover the expense of buying it through energy savings.",

The website was a big help in pushing us over the contemplation stage. We love our Prius Prime. The first  25 miles (or more if driven right) is all electric. After that, we're still getting 54 mpg on gas. However, we use the car almost exclusively for local trips, so we're getting 2000 miles on a single tank of gas. Also, our electricity at home is 100% wind-powered, so that makes the car even more attractive. Add in the government rebates and it's an easy decision.",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Emissions</strong>, anyone? In Massachusetts, transportation accounts for <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ghg-emissions-and-mitigation-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping 43%</a> &nbsp;of our greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles, in combination with renewable, carbon-free electricity generation, can dramatically reduce your greenhouse gas emissions because they have lower lifecycle emissions than gas-powered cars, even after accounting for extra emissions from battery manufacturing. (<a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy 100% renewable electricity</a> &nbsp;at a small premium with Green Powered.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a renewably-powered EV, the only source of emissions comes from the manufacturing process. If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

To subscribe to their quarterly email <strong>newsletter </strong>with news on the latest models and deals, and invitations to EV showcase events, <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/takeaction/takethepledge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">take the pledge</a> (it is non-binding).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Want to talk to someone local?</strong> Contact our very own Wayland EV coaches Shelley and Sabine by filling in <a href=\"Electric%20Vehicle%20coach:%20Shelley%20Trucksis%20and%20Sabine%20von%20Mering%20-%20%20form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this form</a>. They can get you started!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Buying and leasing - cost, deals, and incentives. </strong>Buying or leasing an EV costs about the same as buying or leasing an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) car, <em>but </em>before you walk into that dealership, make sure to check with DriveGreen about <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">state and federal rebates</a> (which vary according to the model, the make, and the price) and <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/preownedevs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pre-owned EVs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also read <strong>testimonials </strong>and stories from local EV drivers right here, under the Testimonials tab above. And check our Events page for upcoming EV webinars and in person showcase and test drive events.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Make it even better by using renewable sources</a> for your home electric source. If the electricity that runs the car is generated by renewables, then you have taken an even bigger step to limit emissions. For a small premium, make the switch to 100% Renewable Electricity with <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Green Powered</a>. You can even combine that with <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/2089\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Solar</a>. Or you can generate your own electrivity by <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">installing a solar array.</a></p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p>Incredibly, over 51% of the trash that goes to landfills is compostable. In the US, we throw out roughly 60 millions tons of food each year, not only wasting valuable resources (food, and organic fertilizer) but also contributing to methane, a gas with a warming potential roughly 21 times that of carbon dioxide. We&rsquo;re putting a stop to that, household by household, town by town!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why we recommend Black Earth.</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are aware that there are other haulers in our town that offer this service, and if you use these, we welcome your thoughts (email info@energizewayland.org or leave a testimonial on this site). But these are two ways in which Black Earth stands out for us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>First, unlike trash haulers, they compost the collections themselves (at their operation in Manchester-by-the-Sea) according to strict DEP rules. They have demonstrated to us their process, and have invited us to come for a tour in spring or summer. Let us know if you want to come on this field trip.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Second, they also sell this finished compost. For that reason they are more strict than anyone else in the business (that we know of) about what they take for compostable cutlery, plates, and pizza boxes, taking only BPI-certified (by the Biodegradable Products Institute). They do this to avoid plastics in their end product (more info here). This tells us that they deeply value the quality of their compost and the environment, even at the risk of losing some customers.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>",
                "about": "<p>Hate to trash food scraps but can't compost yourself? Want to reduce your household waste by up to 50%? Not have a smelly trash bin? Get quality compost? Reduce your carbon footprint? Save your septic?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons to make sure food scraps get composted and returned to soil!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can of course also compost yourself!

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Air travel is one of the largest contributors of carbon emissions across the world.</strong> And it keeps on growing. In 2018, Americans flew a record high 1.5 trillion miles, and carbon emissions from jet-fuel have been increasing 4% per year. Global air travel is expected to nearly double in the next 20 years. So at current rates of passenger flight growth, air travel could account for over 25% of global carbon emissions by 2050.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, one round-trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Beijing emits more CO2 per passenger than the average car in the United States does in an entire year. Other carbon calculators estimate that just one round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles can emit as much carbon as the average car does per year. And sadly it\u2019s not like airplane manufacturers are hard at work making their vehicles more fuel efficient.</p>",

They do this by purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from a renewable energy generator on your behalf. Your contributions for REC purchases, and those of thousands of other GECA members, thereby increase demand for renewable energy on the New England power grid, fund new sources of renewable power, and reduce our need to burn fossil fuels for electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Heads up! </strong>At Town Meeting in 2020, Waylanders will have a chance to vote for Community Choice Aggregation that could increase the default renewable content of our residential electric supply. Check <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/737\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>&nbsp;for more details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why dp we recommend the Green Energy Consumers Alliance </strong>(GECA) as a Preferred Partner for green electricity? Our partner, MassEnergize, has reviewed a number of options and selected the Green Powered program because it actually increases the share of renewable energy in Massachusetts. They are also a non-profit, and they are local. MassEnergize and EnergizeWayland receive no money from GECA.&nbsp;</p>",

They've been connecting their members with local clean energy sources for more than ten years now.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now you can ignore those annoying phone calls from companies you've never heard of asking you to switch to \"green energy\". Most of those companies do nothing to increase the renewable share of electricity in New England. In contrast, GECA customers actually do.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can choose to switch 100% or to 25%</strong> of your consumption to renewable power. You will continue to pay your electric bill as you normally would and will be billed separately, just a few cents extra per kilowatt-hour, for the renewable energy. Moreover, these payments are 100% federally tax-deductible!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://massenergize-prod-files.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Untitled_500__100_px_7-230518-003039.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /><strong>Click on the Steps to Take tab above to find </strong><strong>Practical steps.</strong></p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p>Incredibly, over 51% of the trash that goes to landfills is compostable. In the US, we throw out roughly 60 millions tons of food each year, not only wasting valuable resources (food, and organic fertilizer) but also contributing to methane, a gas with a warming potential roughly 21 times that of carbon dioxide. We&rsquo;re putting a stop to that, household by household, town by town!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why we recommend Black Earth.</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are aware that there are other haulers in our town that offer this service, and if you use these, we welcome your thoughts (email info@energizewayland.org or leave a testimonial on this site). But these are two ways in which Black Earth stands out for us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>First, unlike trash haulers, they compost the collections themselves (at their operation in Manchester-by-the-Sea) according to strict DEP rules. They have demonstrated to us their process, and have invited us to come for a tour in spring or summer. Let us know if you want to come on this field trip.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Second, they also sell this finished compost. For that reason they are more strict than anyone else in the business (that we know of) about what they take for compostable cutlery, plates, and pizza boxes, taking only BPI-certified (by the Biodegradable Products Institute). They do this to avoid plastics in their end product (more info here). This tells us that they deeply value the quality of their compost and the environment, even at the risk of losing some customers.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>",
                "about": "<p>Hate to trash food scraps but can't compost yourself? Want to reduce your household waste by up to 50%? Not have a smelly trash bin? Get quality compost? Reduce your carbon footprint? Save your septic?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are many reasons to make sure food scraps get composted and returned to soil!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can of course also compost yourself!

They have been great to work with, and their installations have been top-notch. They have installed over twenty systems in Wayland to raving reviews. For these reasons, Mass Energize decided to continue working with New England Solar Hot Water after Solarize ended.</p>",
                "about": "<p><strong>How it works.</strong> A solar hot water system captures heat from sunlight and circulates the thermal energy to your water tank. Solar hot water systems reduce the use of fossil fuels. They do not fully replace conventional water heaters, but can provide up to 80% of a building\u2019s total hot water needs. See how it works <a href=\"https://www.masscec.com/learn-about-solar-hot-water\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>These systems are passive and therefore practically <strong>maintenance and hassle-free</strong> and keep on working for decades.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Incentives. </strong>Solar tax credits, Alternative Energy Certificates and generous rebates are available, with higher incentives for low- and moderate-income customers. Incentives typically cover 60-80% of the system cost.</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><strong>We have partnered with</strong> <a href=\"http://neshw.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">New England Solar Hot Water</a> (NESHW). Their \u201cNew England Drain Back\u201d system consists of the solar collectors on the roof, the storage tank inside your home, pump and controls, and an insulated line set that runs between the solar collectors and the storage tank. Installation usually takes a day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p>Energize Wayland receives no money from New England Solar Hot Water. A customer already? Used another installer? Let us know how they did by leaving a Testimonial here, or emailing us at info@energizewayland.org.</p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Emissions</strong>, anyone? In Massachusetts, transportation accounts for <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ghg-emissions-and-mitigation-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping 43%</a> &nbsp;of our greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles, in combination with renewable, carbon-free electricity generation, can dramatically reduce your greenhouse gas emissions because they have lower lifecycle emissions than gas-powered cars, even after accounting for extra emissions from battery manufacturing. (<a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy 100% renewable electricity</a> &nbsp;at a small premium with Green Powered.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a renewably-powered EV, the only source of emissions comes from the manufacturing process. If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

All the more reason to switch to LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>LEDs are<strong> inexpensive, last a lot longer, and give excellent light.</strong> They come in a wide variety of styles, shapes, and sizes for many applications, including both indoor and outdoor lighting, and are often compatible with dimmers, motion detectors, and daylight sensors.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>LEDS can save a lot on your electric bill</strong>. They use up to 90% less energy than the old incandescent bulbs which waste a full 90% of their energy on heat, which is why they get so hot. If you replace these old bulbs with LEDs, you can save $100 over the life of the bulb! LEDs also use less enegy than Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL) bulbs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And what about the planetary budget? If every household replaced just one light bulb with an LED we would save enough energy to light two million homes for a whole year and we would also prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that of taking 550,000 vehicles off the road.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Still, they are only used in less than 10% of fixtures! Can we reach 50% use of these great bulbs in our community this year alone? Let\u2019s find out!</p>",

                "deep_dive": "<p>We strongly recommend that you consider going solar asap and cash in on the <strong>incentives:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Federal Investment Tax Credit</strong> (ITC) (recently extended, but future uncertain) 26% &nbsp;on the total cost of your PV solar energy system, for systems installed in 2020-2022, and 22% for systems installed in 2023. This tax credit expires starting in 2024 unless Congress renews it. (This applies only to those who buy their PV system outright, either with a cash purchase or solar loan). If you don't pay a lot of federal taxes, you can claim the credit over multiple years. There is no $ limit on the credit, and the cost of roof replacement or tree work related to the installation may be eligible for the tax credit as well.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>MA income tax credit</strong> of 15% coverage of the system cost, with a $1000 maximum credit amount. Also only for homeowners.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target</strong> (SMART): the State of Massachusetts pays utility customers a fixed rate per kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar energy produced for 10 years. For systems under 25 kilowatts (kW), the rate ranges from 29 to 31 cents per kWh, depending upon your location and utility. For comparison, the regular retail rate in MA is closer to 20 cents, indicating large savings from the SMART incentives. The state also provides higher incentive rates for low-income customers or those who install battery storage to pair with their solar panel system, making solar power more accessible to more customers in the state.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sales tax and property tax incentives</strong> are two additional major Massachusetts tax exemptions for solar homeowners. Both of these tax breaks are attractive ones because they ensure 100% tax exemption from both sales and property tax payments which certainly add up over time.</li>\r\n<li>Retirees or single earner families with <strong>lower incomes</strong> may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.masssolarloan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mass Solar Loan</a> incentives and see even quicker payback.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Net metering</strong>: solar homeowners receive bill credits from their utility for the energy they are overproducing and sending back to the grid.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>How does solar power work?</strong> Solar electric systems, also known as solar photovoltaics or solar PV, convert sunlight into electrical energy through an array of solar panels that connect to a building&rsquo;s electrical system or directly to the electrical grid. The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) has some good background information on this here.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I know if my home is good for solar?</strong> You can view your roof on Google Maps (click on the Earth box and enter your address) to get a sense for its orientation and potential shading from trees. South-facing roofs with little shade are best, but east and west-facing roofs work well too as long as there is little shade. Ideal roofs have long expanses of open areas but panels can be placed on smaller areas as well. Any installer you contact should be able to tell you on the phone if your roof is a good candidate. Some installers only want to work on the best roofs, but ultimately let it be up to you to decide if you want solar or not. In Wayland we have homeowners who went ahead even though their roofs would have been declined by some installers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What if my roof is old?</strong> Should I replace it before installing solar panels? 15 years is about the dividing line between installing panels on the current roof and replacing the roof and then installing panels. If you install the panels on the existing roof, the panels will protect the part of the roof on which they are installed. You can have the panels taken off and reinstalled when you decide to re-roof.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do I have to maintain my solar system?</strong> Generally the panels will sit up on the roof out of sight and out of mind, powering your home, even on cloudy days. There are no maintenance contracts to buy and New England weather will keep the panels pretty clean.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when it snows? </strong>Snow will pile up on solar panels, but the sun&rsquo;s energy soon melts the bottom layer next to the panels and the snow will come sliding down quickly. Snow guards are available to protect people and plants under the panels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What about critters? </strong>If you frequently see squirrels on your roof, you can add critter guards to prevent them from damaging your system wiring.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I get paid for the electricity my system sends to the electric grid? </strong>On the days that your system makes more electricity than you consume, your meter will run backward. This is called net-metering. If you underproduce/overconsume over the billing period. Instead, Everource or National Grid will charge you for the total amount of kWhs (kilowatt-hours) for the excess used kWhs at the full residential electricity rate. If your system has overproduced, Everource or National Grid will not pay you back at the end of the billing period, they will put those kwHs in reserve. You can use up that credit during the darker months, when you won't produce as much. If at the end of a full year you still have a credit, you can \"Schedule Z\" it to any other electricity user in your load-zone. You can ask that off taker for $$, or donate it. More info <a href=\"https://www.energysage.com/net-metering/eversource/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> .</li>\r\n<li><strong>How big should my solar system be? </strong>Since selling excess electricity isn't that straightforward (yet!), it makes sense to have a system that is properly &ldquo;sized&rdquo; just to cover your electric bill. However, you may decide to install a bigger solar system with future added electricity use in mind, like an electric car, or air-source heat pumps for heating and cooling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What is the process of going solar?</strong> Generally a solar installer will ask for a copy of your electric bill and will prepare a proposed layout and financial estimate based on that and your roof space. Some parts of your roof may get more sun than others; you can change the layout to meet your needs. Once you have approved the design and signed off on the financials, the solar installer will handle the installation, checking roof structural support, pulling permits, obtaining equipment and scheduling the work. It may be a month or two until installation. Actual installation usually takes 2 days &ndash; electrical work and roof racking on day 1 and panel installation on day 2. After building and electrical inspections, Eversource or National Grid will install a new meter and give you approval to power up your system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when the grid is down? </strong>If you're looking to keep powering your home when the grid is down, you'll have to add a backup battery system, which is an expensive option. Otherwise, if there is a power outage, your electricity generation will be disabled during the power outage.</li>\r\n</ol>",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>What are heat pumps?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While traditional heating systems burn fuel to create heat, a heat pump instead works by &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; heat into or out of a home. Though they require electricity to operate, heat pumps use 20 percent to 50 percent of the electricity that would be used by traditional electric heaters. A heat pump can supplement your existing heating system or completely replace it. Heat pumps make the most economic sense if your home is currently heated with oil, propane, or electric baseboards.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are two basic types of heat pumps</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Air-Source Heat Pumps (ASHPs) exchange heat with the air outside your home. Some ASHPs are efficient down to sub-zero outdoor temperatures. ASHPs for homes that already have ducting are called central heat pumps, while so-called ductless \"mini-splits\" are suited for homes that don&rsquo;t have existing ducting. All ASHPs provide energy-efficient heating and cooling for your home. ASHPs use 30 to 50 pecent as much electricity as traditional electric heaters such as electric baseboards. Download the <a href=\"https://neep.org/sites/default/files/resources/ASHP_buyingguide_5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NEEP Air-Source Heat Pump Buyers Guide</a> &nbsp;for more info.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) can provide highly efficient heating, cooling, and water heating by utilizing the nearly constant temperature underground to heat or cool your home. GSHPs are typically the most efficient type of heat pump, but installation is more complex and the initial cost is somewhat higher than ASHPs.

After months of research, we selected a Bryant dual fuel heat pump \u2013 gas furnace option.  The electric heat pump provides heating at temperatures above 35 degrees and air conditioning. When the temperature drops below 35 degrees the gas system kicks in. This combo was a great solution to meet our goals \u2013 reducing our greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining affordable heating costs.  The system is great! Our home is more comfortable with the modulating system creating a more consistent and hence comfortable temperature. The Bryant controls are super easy to use both via the digital thermostat and their app, which is very intuitive. \nWe selected Rodenhiser Plumbing and Heating do the work, after reviewing quotes from 4 contractors. They were helpful in explaining alternative configurations/options, as well identifying relevant rebates and submitting the paperwork. The installation crews were professional and diligent and answering our numerous questions. ",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>What are heat pumps?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While traditional heating systems burn fuel to create heat, a heat pump instead works by &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; heat into or out of a home. Though they require electricity to operate, heat pumps use 20 percent to 50 percent of the electricity that would be used by traditional electric heaters. A heat pump can supplement your existing heating system or completely replace it. Heat pumps make the most economic sense if your home is currently heated with oil, propane, or electric baseboards.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are two basic types of heat pumps</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Air-Source Heat Pumps (ASHPs) exchange heat with the air outside your home. Some ASHPs are efficient down to sub-zero outdoor temperatures. ASHPs for homes that already have ducting are called central heat pumps, while so-called ductless \"mini-splits\" are suited for homes that don&rsquo;t have existing ducting. All ASHPs provide energy-efficient heating and cooling for your home. ASHPs use 30 to 50 pecent as much electricity as traditional electric heaters such as electric baseboards. Download the <a href=\"https://neep.org/sites/default/files/resources/ASHP_buyingguide_5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NEEP Air-Source Heat Pump Buyers Guide</a> &nbsp;for more info.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) can provide highly efficient heating, cooling, and water heating by utilizing the nearly constant temperature underground to heat or cool your home. GSHPs are typically the most efficient type of heat pump, but installation is more complex and the initial cost is somewhat higher than ASHPs.

            "body": "When the U.N. made its most recent Global Warning announcement, I decided to act to significantly reduce his use of gasoline. I looked at the Honda Insight (Hybrid only) and the Chevrolet Volt, but in October bought a Honda Clarity! One of the better plug-ins available, I believe. I drive the first 40 miles each day on electricity only. This makes most of my days gas free! Hybrid mileage (for those above 40 miles/day) at 44 mpg. So far, I have driven about 1300 miles and only used 5 gallons of gas! i.e. 260 mpg!! I have purchased my electricity from a green provider. Therefore, I am driving on solar and wind for the first 40 miles/day \u2013 which, for me, is most of my daily use. With rebates ($10,000 total) and Honda discounts, this car listing at $34,450 can be purchased at a new cost of about $20,000! Same list price as the Volt, but $1000s of dollars more Dealer discount. I think it\u2019s a bigger better car! The Bolt (all electric) is about $3000 more. It is a mid-sized car about the size of a Camry, Accord, etc. Nice styling. Great, quiet (silent) ride when on electric! I plug in at night and in 12 hours I get fully charged using standard 120 volt connection \u2013 ready for the next day. No need for 240 voltage at additional $1000 or so. Other comments: Mileage costs are favorable, but electricity is not free. Therefore my mileage costs (gas only vs electricity/gas) are favorable but muted. I believe I will be using about 600 gallons less in gas and save about $300 in the process. Advantages of a plug-in Hybrid over full electric car: Greater range, can always be filled with gasoline (at a gas station and immediately). No anxiety! Disadvantage: Much less electric only range for long distance travel \u2013 so if mileage/day is extensive the plug-in Hybrid may not be best option. Hope this helps anyone else considering!\n",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Emissions</strong>, anyone? In Massachusetts, transportation accounts for <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ghg-emissions-and-mitigation-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping 43%</a> &nbsp;of our greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles, in combination with renewable, carbon-free electricity generation, can dramatically reduce your greenhouse gas emissions because they have lower lifecycle emissions than gas-powered cars, even after accounting for extra emissions from battery manufacturing. (<a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy 100% renewable electricity</a> &nbsp;at a small premium with Green Powered.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a renewably-powered EV, the only source of emissions comes from the manufacturing process. If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

They can get you started!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Buying and leasing - cost, deals, and incentives. </strong>Buying or leasing an EV costs about the same as buying or leasing an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) car, <em>but </em>before you walk into that dealership, make sure to check with DriveGreen about <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">state and federal rebates</a> (which vary according to the model, the make, and the price) and <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/preownedevs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pre-owned EVs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also read <strong>testimonials </strong>and stories from local EV drivers right here, under the Testimonials tab above. And check our Events page for upcoming EV webinars and in person showcase and test drive events.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Make it even better by using renewable sources</a> for your home electric source. If the electricity that runs the car is generated by renewables, then you have taken an even bigger step to limit emissions. For a small premium, make the switch to 100% Renewable Electricity with <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Green Powered</a>. You can even combine that with <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/2089\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Solar</a>. Or you can generate your own electrivity by <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">installing a solar array.</a></p>",

All the more reason to switch to LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>LEDs are<strong> inexpensive, last a lot longer, and give excellent light.</strong> They come in a wide variety of styles, shapes, and sizes for many applications, including both indoor and outdoor lighting, and are often compatible with dimmers, motion detectors, and daylight sensors.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>LEDS can save a lot on your electric bill</strong>. They use up to 90% less energy than the old incandescent bulbs which waste a full 90% of their energy on heat, which is why they get so hot. If you replace these old bulbs with LEDs, you can save $100 over the life of the bulb! LEDs also use less enegy than Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL) bulbs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And what about the planetary budget? If every household replaced just one light bulb with an LED we would save enough energy to light two million homes for a whole year and we would also prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that of taking 550,000 vehicles off the road.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Still, they are only used in less than 10% of fixtures! Can we reach 50% use of these great bulbs in our community this year alone? Let\u2019s find out!</p>",

Black Earth is the company I turned to when, in September, I had a family party at my house for approximately 70 people to celebrate my son\u2019s marriage.  To be kind to the environment, I could either rent dishes etc. or, per suggestion of a good friend, use compostable plates, cups and flatware, which I didn\u2019t even know existed. I turned to Black Earth Compost for advice and they helped every step of the way.  They provided links to places where I could buy the compostable items, arranged a special drop off of large compost bins to collect the food scraps, dinnerware, and paper napkins, it all and picked up all of it after the party. No dishes, and zero waste!  I had a lot of questions and they promptly answered them all.  I was so pleased that I signed up with them for this new weekly curbside pickup program.  They provided a small, manageable rolling bin with compostable liner bags that keep the bin clean, and they also gave us compostable plastic liners for our countertop compost jar, all of this making it easy with no mess. This was our first week and everything was picked up promptly.  I couldn\u2019t recommend this service more highly.",

                "deep_dive": "<p>Incredibly, over 51% of the trash that goes to landfills is compostable. In the US, we throw out roughly 60 millions tons of food each year, not only wasting valuable resources (food, and organic fertilizer) but also contributing to methane, a gas with a warming potential roughly 21 times that of carbon dioxide. We&rsquo;re putting a stop to that, household by household, town by town!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why we recommend Black Earth.</strong></p>\r\n<p>We are aware that there are other haulers in our town that offer this service, and if you use these, we welcome your thoughts (email info@energizewayland.org or leave a testimonial on this site). But these are two ways in which Black Earth stands out for us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>First, unlike trash haulers, they compost the collections themselves (at their operation in Manchester-by-the-Sea) according to strict DEP rules. They have demonstrated to us their process, and have invited us to come for a tour in spring or summer. Let us know if you want to come on this field trip.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Second, they also sell this finished compost. For that reason they are more strict than anyone else in the business (that we know of) about what they take for compostable cutlery, plates, and pizza boxes, taking only BPI-certified (by the Biodegradable Products Institute). They do this to avoid plastics in their end product (more info here). This tells us that they deeply value the quality of their compost and the environment, even at the risk of losing some customers.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>",

                "deep_dive": "<p>We strongly recommend that you consider going solar asap and cash in on the <strong>incentives:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Federal Investment Tax Credit</strong> (ITC) (recently extended, but future uncertain) 26% &nbsp;on the total cost of your PV solar energy system, for systems installed in 2020-2022, and 22% for systems installed in 2023. This tax credit expires starting in 2024 unless Congress renews it. (This applies only to those who buy their PV system outright, either with a cash purchase or solar loan). If you don't pay a lot of federal taxes, you can claim the credit over multiple years. There is no $ limit on the credit, and the cost of roof replacement or tree work related to the installation may be eligible for the tax credit as well.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>MA income tax credit</strong> of 15% coverage of the system cost, with a $1000 maximum credit amount. Also only for homeowners.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target</strong> (SMART): the State of Massachusetts pays utility customers a fixed rate per kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar energy produced for 10 years. For systems under 25 kilowatts (kW), the rate ranges from 29 to 31 cents per kWh, depending upon your location and utility. For comparison, the regular retail rate in MA is closer to 20 cents, indicating large savings from the SMART incentives. The state also provides higher incentive rates for low-income customers or those who install battery storage to pair with their solar panel system, making solar power more accessible to more customers in the state.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sales tax and property tax incentives</strong> are two additional major Massachusetts tax exemptions for solar homeowners. Both of these tax breaks are attractive ones because they ensure 100% tax exemption from both sales and property tax payments which certainly add up over time.</li>\r\n<li>Retirees or single earner families with <strong>lower incomes</strong> may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.masssolarloan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mass Solar Loan</a> incentives and see even quicker payback.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Net metering</strong>: solar homeowners receive bill credits from their utility for the energy they are overproducing and sending back to the grid.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>How does solar power work?</strong> Solar electric systems, also known as solar photovoltaics or solar PV, convert sunlight into electrical energy through an array of solar panels that connect to a building&rsquo;s electrical system or directly to the electrical grid. The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) has some good background information on this here.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I know if my home is good for solar?</strong> You can view your roof on Google Maps (click on the Earth box and enter your address) to get a sense for its orientation and potential shading from trees. South-facing roofs with little shade are best, but east and west-facing roofs work well too as long as there is little shade. Ideal roofs have long expanses of open areas but panels can be placed on smaller areas as well. Any installer you contact should be able to tell you on the phone if your roof is a good candidate. Some installers only want to work on the best roofs, but ultimately let it be up to you to decide if you want solar or not. In Wayland we have homeowners who went ahead even though their roofs would have been declined by some installers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What if my roof is old?</strong> Should I replace it before installing solar panels? 15 years is about the dividing line between installing panels on the current roof and replacing the roof and then installing panels. If you install the panels on the existing roof, the panels will protect the part of the roof on which they are installed. You can have the panels taken off and reinstalled when you decide to re-roof.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do I have to maintain my solar system?</strong> Generally the panels will sit up on the roof out of sight and out of mind, powering your home, even on cloudy days. There are no maintenance contracts to buy and New England weather will keep the panels pretty clean.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when it snows? </strong>Snow will pile up on solar panels, but the sun&rsquo;s energy soon melts the bottom layer next to the panels and the snow will come sliding down quickly. Snow guards are available to protect people and plants under the panels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What about critters? </strong>If you frequently see squirrels on your roof, you can add critter guards to prevent them from damaging your system wiring.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I get paid for the electricity my system sends to the electric grid? </strong>On the days that your system makes more electricity than you consume, your meter will run backward. This is called net-metering. If you underproduce/overconsume over the billing period. Instead, Everource or National Grid will charge you for the total amount of kWhs (kilowatt-hours) for the excess used kWhs at the full residential electricity rate. If your system has overproduced, Everource or National Grid will not pay you back at the end of the billing period, they will put those kwHs in reserve. You can use up that credit during the darker months, when you won't produce as much. If at the end of a full year you still have a credit, you can \"Schedule Z\" it to any other electricity user in your load-zone. You can ask that off taker for $$, or donate it. More info <a href=\"https://www.energysage.com/net-metering/eversource/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> .</li>\r\n<li><strong>How big should my solar system be? </strong>Since selling excess electricity isn't that straightforward (yet!), it makes sense to have a system that is properly &ldquo;sized&rdquo; just to cover your electric bill. However, you may decide to install a bigger solar system with future added electricity use in mind, like an electric car, or air-source heat pumps for heating and cooling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What is the process of going solar?</strong> Generally a solar installer will ask for a copy of your electric bill and will prepare a proposed layout and financial estimate based on that and your roof space. Some parts of your roof may get more sun than others; you can change the layout to meet your needs. Once you have approved the design and signed off on the financials, the solar installer will handle the installation, checking roof structural support, pulling permits, obtaining equipment and scheduling the work. It may be a month or two until installation. Actual installation usually takes 2 days &ndash; electrical work and roof racking on day 1 and panel installation on day 2. After building and electrical inspections, Eversource or National Grid will install a new meter and give you approval to power up your system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when the grid is down? </strong>If you're looking to keep powering your home when the grid is down, you'll have to add a backup battery system, which is an expensive option. Otherwise, if there is a power outage, your electricity generation will be disabled during the power outage.</li>\r\n</ol>",

                "deep_dive": "<p>We strongly recommend that you consider going solar asap and cash in on the <strong>incentives:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Federal Investment Tax Credit</strong> (ITC) (recently extended, but future uncertain) 26% &nbsp;on the total cost of your PV solar energy system, for systems installed in 2020-2022, and 22% for systems installed in 2023. This tax credit expires starting in 2024 unless Congress renews it. (This applies only to those who buy their PV system outright, either with a cash purchase or solar loan). If you don't pay a lot of federal taxes, you can claim the credit over multiple years. There is no $ limit on the credit, and the cost of roof replacement or tree work related to the installation may be eligible for the tax credit as well.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>MA income tax credit</strong> of 15% coverage of the system cost, with a $1000 maximum credit amount. Also only for homeowners.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target</strong> (SMART): the State of Massachusetts pays utility customers a fixed rate per kilowatt hour (kWh) of solar energy produced for 10 years. For systems under 25 kilowatts (kW), the rate ranges from 29 to 31 cents per kWh, depending upon your location and utility. For comparison, the regular retail rate in MA is closer to 20 cents, indicating large savings from the SMART incentives. The state also provides higher incentive rates for low-income customers or those who install battery storage to pair with their solar panel system, making solar power more accessible to more customers in the state.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sales tax and property tax incentives</strong> are two additional major Massachusetts tax exemptions for solar homeowners. Both of these tax breaks are attractive ones because they ensure 100% tax exemption from both sales and property tax payments which certainly add up over time.</li>\r\n<li>Retirees or single earner families with <strong>lower incomes</strong> may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.masssolarloan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mass Solar Loan</a> incentives and see even quicker payback.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Net metering</strong>: solar homeowners receive bill credits from their utility for the energy they are overproducing and sending back to the grid.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>How does solar power work?</strong> Solar electric systems, also known as solar photovoltaics or solar PV, convert sunlight into electrical energy through an array of solar panels that connect to a building&rsquo;s electrical system or directly to the electrical grid. The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) has some good background information on this here.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I know if my home is good for solar?</strong> You can view your roof on Google Maps (click on the Earth box and enter your address) to get a sense for its orientation and potential shading from trees. South-facing roofs with little shade are best, but east and west-facing roofs work well too as long as there is little shade. Ideal roofs have long expanses of open areas but panels can be placed on smaller areas as well. Any installer you contact should be able to tell you on the phone if your roof is a good candidate. Some installers only want to work on the best roofs, but ultimately let it be up to you to decide if you want solar or not. In Wayland we have homeowners who went ahead even though their roofs would have been declined by some installers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What if my roof is old?</strong> Should I replace it before installing solar panels? 15 years is about the dividing line between installing panels on the current roof and replacing the roof and then installing panels. If you install the panels on the existing roof, the panels will protect the part of the roof on which they are installed. You can have the panels taken off and reinstalled when you decide to re-roof.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Do I have to maintain my solar system?</strong> Generally the panels will sit up on the roof out of sight and out of mind, powering your home, even on cloudy days. There are no maintenance contracts to buy and New England weather will keep the panels pretty clean.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when it snows? </strong>Snow will pile up on solar panels, but the sun&rsquo;s energy soon melts the bottom layer next to the panels and the snow will come sliding down quickly. Snow guards are available to protect people and plants under the panels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What about critters? </strong>If you frequently see squirrels on your roof, you can add critter guards to prevent them from damaging your system wiring.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How do I get paid for the electricity my system sends to the electric grid? </strong>On the days that your system makes more electricity than you consume, your meter will run backward. This is called net-metering. If you underproduce/overconsume over the billing period. Instead, Everource or National Grid will charge you for the total amount of kWhs (kilowatt-hours) for the excess used kWhs at the full residential electricity rate. If your system has overproduced, Everource or National Grid will not pay you back at the end of the billing period, they will put those kwHs in reserve. You can use up that credit during the darker months, when you won't produce as much. If at the end of a full year you still have a credit, you can \"Schedule Z\" it to any other electricity user in your load-zone. You can ask that off taker for $$, or donate it. More info <a href=\"https://www.energysage.com/net-metering/eversource/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> .</li>\r\n<li><strong>How big should my solar system be? </strong>Since selling excess electricity isn't that straightforward (yet!), it makes sense to have a system that is properly &ldquo;sized&rdquo; just to cover your electric bill. However, you may decide to install a bigger solar system with future added electricity use in mind, like an electric car, or air-source heat pumps for heating and cooling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What is the process of going solar?</strong> Generally a solar installer will ask for a copy of your electric bill and will prepare a proposed layout and financial estimate based on that and your roof space. Some parts of your roof may get more sun than others; you can change the layout to meet your needs. Once you have approved the design and signed off on the financials, the solar installer will handle the installation, checking roof structural support, pulling permits, obtaining equipment and scheduling the work. It may be a month or two until installation. Actual installation usually takes 2 days &ndash; electrical work and roof racking on day 1 and panel installation on day 2. After building and electrical inspections, Eversource or National Grid will install a new meter and give you approval to power up your system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What happens when the grid is down? </strong>If you're looking to keep powering your home when the grid is down, you'll have to add a backup battery system, which is an expensive option.

Read their testominials under the Testimonials Tab above.&nbsp;These arrays are in effect private power plants, collectively generating renewable energy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://massenergize-prod-files.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Untitled_design-230517-202905.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /> Due to falling prices and generous incentives...</strong></p>\r\n<p>you can often install a system that will pay for itself in 5-7 years if you have a suitable site. After that it&rsquo;s all positive cash flow as the panels generate power for 25 years or more. It's like a small 401(k) on your roof! Retirees or single earner families with lower incomes may qualify for Mass Solar Loan incentives and see even quicker payback. On top of that, solar panels increase the value of your home.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Solar PV produces home-grown, safely-generated, clean electricity</strong> that contributes clean energy to the electric grid and reduces your CO2 emissions as well as nasty pollutants such as fine particulates, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and ozone. Every solar kWh means one less fossil fuel kWh. The electricity produced can be used to help charge <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">electric cars</a> and transition away from burning oil and natural gas by powering <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high-efficiency electric heat pumps</a> for home heating and cooling.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://massenergize-prod-files.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Untitled_500__100_px_7-230518-003039.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /><strong>Click on the Steps to Take tab above to find </strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>practical steps</li>\r\n<li>a team of Wayland volunteer coaches to help you get started!</li>\r\n</ol>",

To help understand the dynamics of this system I also installed a Sense home energy monitor. Air source heat pumps become less efficient as the outside temperature drops, and it sure did drop this year. I have been able to use data from the Sense to compare the energy consumption of the heat pump to the run time of our aging gas boiler. The next step will be to install wirelessly controlled thermostats for the boiler. With them in place I will be able to automate the boiler setback and turn on the heat pump to maximize efficiency using the IFTTT automation system. This is an ongoing project but we are already seeing benefits, especially as the days grow longer and solar production starts ramping up to offset the cost of running the heat pump.

According to Drawdown.org, \u201chealthy, plant-rich diets [are] one of the most impactful solutions\u201d to reduce dangerous emissions.\n\nI recently connected with a local expert. Diana Goldman is a vegan chef, teacher and founder of BeantownKitchen.com. Her site is full of lots of great recipes, helpful information, and high quality videos. I watched her video on making kale salad, and now always take a few minutes to \"massage\" the kale, making it into a more tender leaf. I make my kale salad with avocados and BBQ sauce, it's super tasty! If you are thinking about eating a more plant-rich diet, check out her website  at beantownkitchen.com!",

In the summer I go almost weekly for veggies to supplement my farmshare box and my own garden produce, as well as delicious local fruits, bread, cheese, fresh gluten-free pasta, and fresh fish. I go because the food is delicious, super-fresh (often picked that morning) and so nutritious, and because I like to talk to the farmers and support their hard work. I also enjoy the live music - Larry and friends always bring a smile to my face.\n\nIn the winter I get all of that, and I also grab a table and chairs in the toasty greenhouse and meet up with friends. We have a snack, or lunch, chat and watch the shoppers and the merchants. It\u2019s the city in the town, once a week. \nThe picture was taken one winter when my sister and brother-in-law came all the way from Cambridge for the market. We picked up fresh pasta, dried tea, Karma coffee, and a felting project. There is always something for everyone.",

                "deep_dive": "<p>Local food has fewer \"food miles\" on it, which means fewer miles of it sitting in a refrigerated, polluting, gas-guzzling truck to get to your table. According to <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es702969f\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">this source</a> &nbsp;in the US, conventionally distributed food is often said to travel 1,500 miles from farm to plate, which is responsible for 5 to 17 times more CO2 than local and regionally produced food.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But transportation accounts for only 11 percent of food\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of total food emissions happens during its production phase, accounting for a whopping 83 percent of total household emissions worldwide (the majority is non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions such as nitrous oxide and methane emissions).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>You can address the production part of the \u201cfoodprint\u201d as well by buying local at the market, because local farms are small farms and mall farms more readily adopt climate friendly practices that curtail these emissions. They often use less pesticides, rebuild crop and insect diversity, enrich the soil with cover crops, create border areas for wildlife, and produce tastier and more nutritious food. Many small farmers are even working on sequestering carbon that is already in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Buying local food will also help to keep local land in production. Local - and hence decentralized - production also reduces food safety risks, as long-distance food can potentially be contaminated at many points on its journey to our plates.</p>",

Both the Summer and the Winter Farmers\u2019 Markets are one-stop-shopping with vegetables (of course), fish, meat, mushrooms, cheese, breads, jams and jellies and pickles, pasta, desserts and ice cream and fresh-squeezed lemonade! It's like a supermarket only better because the food is local, directly from the farm.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Buying local food means fewer emissions. And at the market you get to meet the person who actually grew and/or prepared your food. Talk about instant feedback! Ask them, do they use pesticides on their fields? How do they treat their animals? Did they add preservatives to their cookies? These farmers will gladly answer your questions. Local also means you will be spending your money on local people, who will then spend it locally too.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The markets are also a ton more fun than the supermarket. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Other actions with which to address your \u201cfoodprint\u201d are by composting food waste by <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/16\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">buying a CSA farmshare</a> , <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/53\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">having it picked up at the curb</a> or by <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/33\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">composting it yourself</a> , and of course by <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/18\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">growing some of your food yourself</a> .&nbsp;</p>",

            "body": "In 2019 MassEnergize started partnering with Pearl Certification, a national program designed to help homeowners capture the value of their home\u2019s environmentally friendly and efficient features when they sell the property.\n\nI was preparing to put my own home in Wayland on the rental market and offered it as a guinea pig for the pilot. . It is a modest ranch that has accumulated many energy-efficiency improvements over the years: insulation and efficient windows, a solar photovoltaic array, solar hot water, an efficient furnace and appliances, and a level-II charger for their electric vehicle. \n\nThey sent a local Pearl trained inspector who conducted an in-depth, independent inventory examining the construction techniques, heating and cooling equipment, lighting, and ventilation. Turns out my home met Pearl\u2019s stringent criteria and received a Pearl Gold Certification. They then issued a report showcasing the home\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d features and upgrades. \n\nPart of the package were glossy cards explaining the specific benefits of my home\u2019s energy efficiency features. They explained not only the visible features like the solar PV and the solar hot water, but also invisible ones like attic and wall insulation and the high-quality heating system, outlining their benefits in comfort, efficiency, and cost savings.\n\nMy realtor used these materials when showing my home, and it was rented out within six days!\n\nIf you have an energy efficient home, you\u2019ve invested top dollar. Realtors who tell you that that\u2019s not worth anything on the market are wrong. But those who see the value often do not know how to market them. Pearl helps them do this. Let your realtor know about them, and the process is pretty simple!",

            "body": "When Satra and I heard about the great DriveGreen deal that the Green Energy Consumers Alliance had made with Marlboro Nissan, we wasted no time. Concerned about climate change, we had wanted to replace our old car with an electric vehicle, and this deal made it a no-brainer. We walked into the dealership, put that deal on the table (bypassing all the sales pressure), and signed.\n\nOnce we had picked up our LEAF we boasted about it and the DriveGreen program to all our friends and relatives. A week later, Satra's sister soon surprised us with her own DriveGreen LEAF from Milford Nissan! Here's a family photograph of us and our clean electric cars, taken on a day in February when temperatures reached 70F. How appropriate!\n\nFast forward to August and we wanted to take a trip to NYC. We have another car that takes gas, but chose to take the LEAF anyway. Officially it has a range of 120 miles, but in summer and if you drive in a certain way (mainly, not above 65 mph), you can tack on another 20 miles. We planned it so we stopped at two fast chargers on the way to NYC. Handy apps show you the closest one and even whether it is in use or not. Each charge to full took a mere 20 (twenty!) minutes, during which we had lunch and a coffee break. On the way back we charged just once - ourselves too, with dinner in the whackiest Chinese restaurant east of the 90. And it was free - the charging, not the dinner.\n\nWith some planning, some efficient driving, and just a little bit of extra time, it was no hardship at all! And range anxiety? What's that?\n",

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>Emissions</strong>, anyone? In Massachusetts, transportation accounts for <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/ghg-emissions-and-mitigation-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a whopping 43%</a> &nbsp;of our greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles, in combination with renewable, carbon-free electricity generation, can dramatically reduce your greenhouse gas emissions because they have lower lifecycle emissions than gas-powered cars, even after accounting for extra emissions from battery manufacturing. (<a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy 100% renewable electricity</a> &nbsp;at a small premium with Green Powered.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With a renewably-powered EV, the only source of emissions comes from the manufacturing process. If the electricity comes from fossil fuels, driving an EV is obviously not entirely pollution free. Still, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, EVs and plug-ins have a much smaller carbon footprint than conventional cars no matter what the source of the electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of great choices</strong> on the market right now, from all-electric to hybrids with plug-in options. They're fun to drive with their great pickup and power. And they're cheaper to run. According to the Department of Energy, electric vehicles can save as much as $1,200 per year in fuel costs. EVs have fewer moving parts and are therefore much cheaper to maintain: they do not need oil changes, and have no transmission fluids, fuel pumps, timing belts and many other moving parts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Range anxiety?</strong> Fully electric vehicles (EV) are constrained by their battery capacity, but the battery range improves by the year and the network of charging stations keeps expanding, with many apps that help you locate public charging stations and if they are available in real time. Most chargers are located conveniently at restaurants or roadside rest stops. Wayland has several public charging stations behind the Town Building (41 Cochituate Road) where you can charge for free (with a ChargePoint card), and at the Stop and Shop at Town Center (40 Boston Post Road). Or enter &ldquo;charging stations Wayland MA&rdquo; into Google Maps and you&rsquo;ll see all the different charging stations in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can plug your car</strong> into any standard 110-120V outlet, but many EV and plug-in owners install a Level II 240 Volt charger, which speeds up charging time up to 6X faster. Equipment plus installation of these chargers cost in the range of $400 to $1,200, depending on the model and how your house is configured. This cost is tax deductible. And we can recommend an electrician to install one for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rebates</strong>. Qualifying battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles are eligible for rebates, and so are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Some electric vehicles qualify for federal income tax credits and state rebates. The amounts depend on the battery size of the vehicle, the model, and, of course, your tax liability (check <a href=\"https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/drivegreen/learnmore/costrebates/rebatesincentives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>, and the dealer will advise you as well).&nbsp;</p>",

As the Sense unit \"learned\" what was using electricity, we discovered that way too much of it was powering a 40-year old freezer that was much larger than needed. Between the state rebates for removing an old appliance and the savings on electricity of a more efficient new unit, our new freezer will \"pay for itself\" in less than three years. Recently we have used the Sense unit to figure out how to reduce our minimum \"always on\" electricity use by 40%.

They are devices like phone chargers, computer cords, gaming consoles, DVRs, TVs, and even coffee pots that draw small amounts of power even when off, and can together add up to as much as 20-25% of your monthly electricity bill in this 'standby mode,' according to <a href=\"https://sense.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sense Energy Monitors</a>. &nbsp;Unplug these devices when not in use, or use plugin on/off switches, power strips and surge protectors. These devices keep electronics at the ready, but truly powered off.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What about appliances that need to stay plugged in?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Make sure they're <strong>ENERGY STAR</strong> products. When buying new electronic products, look for the <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/35\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ENERGY STAR</a> label, which indicates federal certification of energy efficiency. ENERGY STAR products have been designed to waste less energy in standby mode.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wondering if an appliance is still functioning efficiently?</strong> Connect it to the <a href=\"http://www.p3international.com/products/p4400.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kill A Watt</a>&reg;, and it will count consumption by the Kilowatt-hour, same as your local utility. You can calculate your electrical expenses by the day, week, month, even an entire year.

                "deep_dive": "<p><strong>How exactly does that work?</strong> For every kilowatt hour that you use, GECA ensures that a renewable energy generator puts enough power onto the grid to meet your usage. They do this by purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from a renewable energy generator on your behalf. Your contributions for REC purchases, and those of thousands of other GECA members, thereby increase demand for renewable energy on the New England power grid, fund new sources of renewable power, and reduce our need to burn fossil fuels for electricity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Heads up! </strong>At Town Meeting in 2020, Waylanders will have a chance to vote for Community Choice Aggregation that could increase the default renewable content of our residential electric supply. Check <a href=\"https://community.massenergize.org/wayland/actions/737\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>&nbsp;for more details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why dp we recommend the Green Energy Consumers Alliance </strong>(GECA) as a Preferred Partner for green electricity? Our partner, MassEnergize, has reviewed a number of options and selected the Green Powered program because it actually increases the share of renewable energy in Massachusetts. They are also a non-profit, and they are local. MassEnergize and EnergizeWayland receive no money from GECA.&nbsp;</p>",

They've been connecting their members with local clean energy sources for more than ten years now.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now you can ignore those annoying phone calls from companies you've never heard of asking you to switch to \"green energy\". Most of those companies do nothing to increase the renewable share of electricity in New England. In contrast, GECA customers actually do.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can choose to switch 100% or to 25%</strong> of your consumption to renewable power. You will continue to pay your electric bill as you normally would and will be billed separately, just a few cents extra per kilowatt-hour, for the renewable energy. Moreover, these payments are 100% federally tax-deductible!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://massenergize-prod-files.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Untitled_500__100_px_7-230518-003039.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /><strong>Click on the Steps to Take tab above to find </strong><strong>Practical steps.</strong></p>",
